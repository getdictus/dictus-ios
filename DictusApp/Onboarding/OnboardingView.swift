// DictusApp/Onboarding/OnboardingView.swift
// Container for the 5-step onboarding flow using a paged TabView.
import SwiftUI

/// 5-step onboarding flow presented as a fullScreenCover on first launch.
///
/// WHY TabView with page style:
/// TabView(.page) provides native iOS swipe-between-pages UX with page dots.
/// Each page manages its own completion state and calls `onNext` when done,
/// advancing the user to the next step. The user cannot swipe forward past
/// incomplete steps because we disable the tab content for future pages.
///
/// WHY @Binding isComplete:
/// The parent (DictusApp.swift) owns `hasCompletedOnboarding` via @AppStorage.
/// When the last page (TestRecordingPage) finishes, it sets isComplete = true,
/// which writes to App Group UserDefaults and dismisses the fullScreenCover.
struct OnboardingView: View {
    @Binding var isComplete: Bool

    /// WHY @SceneStorage instead of @State:
    /// @SceneStorage persists the value across scene phase changes (background/foreground).
    /// Without this, returning from iOS Settings (e.g., after adding the keyboard) would
    /// reset the onboarding to step 1 because the view gets recreated. @SceneStorage
    /// remembers which page the user was on.
    @SceneStorage("onboarding_currentPage") private var currentPage: Int = 0

    /// Track which steps have been completed to prevent skipping ahead.
