/// 6-step onboarding flow presented as a fullScreenCover on first launch.
///
/// WHY switch/case instead of TabView:
/// TabView(.page) allows the user to swipe between pages, which means they could
/// skip required steps (mic permission, keyboard setup, model download).
/// Using a manual switch/case with @State currentPage ensures the user can ONLY
/// advance via each page's completion button — no swiping. This guarantees every
/// prerequisite is properly set up before the user reaches the test recording step.
///
/// WHY @Binding isComplete:
/// The parent (DictusApp.swift) owns `hasCompletedOnboarding` via @AppStorage.
/// When the last page (TestRecordingPage) finishes, it sets isComplete = true,
/// which writes to App Group UserDefaults and dismisses the fullScreenCover.

    /// @SceneStorage persists the value across scene phase changes (background/foreground).

    /// reset the onboarding to step 1 because the view gets recreated. @SceneStorage
