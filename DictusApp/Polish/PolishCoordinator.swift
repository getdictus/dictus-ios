/// ### What is left here, and why so little (#361)
///
/// The orchestration this type used to hold — the toggle, the language branch, the
/// duration and gibberish gates, the availability gate, the metrics — moved to
/// `PolishService` in DictusCore, because the keyboard extension now runs the same
/// pipeline for keyboard dictations. One pipeline, two call sites (decision 4).
///
/// What could not move is the app-only half: the ring's memory cache and retention,
/// the export, and the prewarm scheduled from the recording. A keyboard dictation
/// never reaches this object at all.
