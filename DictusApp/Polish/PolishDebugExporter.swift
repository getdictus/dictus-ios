/// Wire format for Polish debug exports. Stable schema — when iterating on the
/// Light/Repair prompts, this is what gets shared from the device for analysis.
/// Pretty-printed JSON with sorted keys keeps diffs readable and ingestion robust.
///
/// Schema rationale:
/// - `raw` and `polished` are split fields (not a single diff string) so the
///   reader can compute the diff themselves with any tool.
/// - `outcomes` is an aggregate over `events` for at-a-glance triage; redundant
///   with iterating events but cheap to emit.
/// - `device` and `settings` snapshots make each export self-describing — no
///   need to ask the user which model was active or which language was selected.
