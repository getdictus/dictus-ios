// issue #146 calibrated against it, and that budget exists to catch exactly this — the
// file growing again. Everything here reaches the coordinator through two named seams
// (`loadActiveModelIntoMemory`, `configureAudioSessionForWarmUp`) plus the load epoch
// and the init lock, so moving it out did not mean opening up the coordinator's
// private state wholesale.

        // which it could notice one. The maintainer's device log has it firing in the
        // wild exactly this way: `modelPrewarmTimeout timeout=5s`, logged 212 seconds
