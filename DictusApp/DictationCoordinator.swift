    ///
    /// - `verifyAudioFlow()` already opens with `guard status == .recording`, and an
    ///   abandoned session is `.idle` by then. Its engine restart is unreachable
    ///   after a cancel.
    /// - `setModelLoadState(...)` describes the *model*, which outlives any one
    ///   dictation. Suppressing it would leave the next session reading a load state
    ///   that never happened. Note what does the work in the cold-start catch since
    ///   issue #427: not gating, but writing the true value. Ungated and constant
    ///   `.idle` was how a failed dictation came to contradict a published engine.
    /// - `schedulePolishPrewarm()` warms a model and publishes nothing.
    /// - The stage watchdog re-checks `self.status` against the status it was armed
    ///   for before it fires.
    /// - `pendingColdStartDictation` is retried from `didBecomeActive` only when the
    ///   App Group still reads `.requested`; a cancel writes `.idle` first, so the
    ///   deferred start does not resurrect.
