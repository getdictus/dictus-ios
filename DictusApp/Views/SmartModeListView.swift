// Choosing which Smart Modes the keyboard's long-press fan holds (issue #79).
import SwiftUI

/// The mode list: which modes are in the keyboard's fan, and in what order.
///
/// ### Why pinning exists at all
///
/// The fan is not the catalogue. It holds Normal plus the modes the user pinned,
/// and it holds four entries because that is what fits above 44 pt on the smallest
/// supported screen — see `SmartModeFanLayout`. The catalogue is six modes today
/// (Structured, List and four translation targets) and grows with #269, so a choice
/// has to be made somewhere. It is made here rather than in the keyboard because the keyboard
/// has 52 pt of chrome and no room for a settings screen, and because this is a
/// decision taken once rather than during a dictation.
///
/// ### Order is the user's
///
/// `SmartModeStore.setPinned` preserves it and `SmartModeCatalogue.pinnedModes`
/// honours it, so the fan draws the rows in the order arranged here. That is worth a
/// drag handle: the fan deploys downward from a top-right mic and the nearest row is
/// the cheapest to reach, so which mode sits first is a real ergonomic choice.
struct SmartModeListView: View {

    /// The pinned identifiers, in order. Local state so a reorder is smooth, written
    /// through to the App Group on every change — there is no Save button, and a
    /// screen the user backs out of must not lose what they just arranged.
