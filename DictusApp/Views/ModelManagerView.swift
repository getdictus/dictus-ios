// Model management UI: download, select, and delete WhisperKit models.
// Redesigned with Downloaded/Available sections, gauge-based model cards, and engine descriptions.
// Swipe-to-delete on downloaded non-active model cards (like iOS Mail), plus an
// explicit overflow menu on downloaded cards for discoverability (issue #193).

/// - "Downloaded" — models on device, including deprecated ones
/// - "Available" — models offered for download; excludes deprecated ones except the
///   device's own recommended model (issue #362). Models this device cannot run stay
///   listed and are rendered disabled with a reason (issue #369)
///
/// WHY two sections instead of a flat list:
/// Users need to quickly see what's on their device vs. what they can download.
/// Separating sections provides clear visual hierarchy. Deprecated models (Tiny/Base)
/// only appear in Downloaded if the user already has them — they're hidden from
/// Available to guide users toward better models.
///
/// WHY List instead of ScrollView+VStack:
/// SwiftUI's .swipeActions modifier only works inside List context. We style the List
/// with transparent backgrounds and hidden separators to preserve the glass card aesthetic.
///
/// WHY engine description paragraphs:
/// Users may not know what "WhisperKit" means. A brief explanation helps them
/// understand the technology behind the models they're choosing.
