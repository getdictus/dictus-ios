/// WHY it is presented as a sheet by `HomeView` rather than pushed or given a tab:
/// the issue asks for a vertical transition out of the home screen and a swipe-down
/// back to it, and a sheet is both of those natively — including the interactive,
/// interruptible drag that a hand-rolled transition would have to reimplement. The
/// tab bar stays at three entries, which the brief is explicit about.
///
/// WHY a `List` and not a `ScrollView` of cards: swipe-to-delete is the interaction
/// the issue names, and `List` is the only thing on iOS that gives it — with the
/// right hit area, the right rubber-banding and the right row-removal animation. The
/// glass look survives it: clear row backgrounds, no separators, no list background.
