/// The app has 3 distinct sections (Home, Models, Settings) that the user should be able
/// to switch between freely. A TabView provides standard iOS navigation for this pattern.
/// Each tab wraps its content in its own NavigationStack so push navigation works
/// independently per tab.
///
/// WHY ZStack overlay for RecordingView:
/// When dictation is active, the recording UI must cover the entire screen INCLUDING
/// the tab bar. A ZStack overlay with ignoresSafeArea achieves this, while a sheet or
/// fullScreenCover would leave the tab bar visible underneath on some iOS versions.
