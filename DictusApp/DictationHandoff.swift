/// WHY this is a file of its own rather than part of `DictationCoordinator`: the

/// file past SwiftLint's length limit, which is the linter making the point the
/// header of `ColdStartResolution.swift` makes in prose. Same device, same reason.

/// WHY six members of the coordinator are not `private`: Swift scopes `private` to
/// the file, so `defaults`, `mayReport`, `updateStatus` and the three
/// `polishHandoff*` properties have to be visible from here. Each carries a note at
/// its declaration. `updateStatus` is the one worth watching — it is the single
/// funnel every status write goes through, and it stays that.
