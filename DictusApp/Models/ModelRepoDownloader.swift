// DictusApp/Models/ModelRepoDownloader.swift
// Downloads model files from a HuggingFace repo with real byte-level progress.
import Foundation
import DictusCore
import FluidAudio

/// Downloads a HuggingFace model repo (Parakeet or WhisperKit) into the exact
/// directory the respective engine expects, reporting real byte-level progress.
///
/// WHY this exists (issue #207, App Review rejection of 1.7.1 build 19):
/// FluidAudio's `DownloadUtils.downloadRepo` attaches a `URLSessionDownloadDelegate`
/// but downloads via the async `URLSession.download(for:)` convenience API — and that
/// API never delivers `didWriteData` callbacks, even with a delegate attached (verified
/// empirically; only the classic `downloadTask(with:)` + delegate pattern fires them).
/// Progress therefore only advanced when a whole file completed. Since
/// `Encoder.mlmodelc/weights/weight.bin` alone is ~92% of the ~483 MB payload, the bar
/// sat at ~5% for minutes and then jumped to ~97% — App Review read that as a freeze.
///
/// Issue #210 generalized the class (formerly `ParakeetModelDownloader`) so WhisperKit
/// models get the same MB counter, stall detection, and resume. The engine-specific
/// knowledge (repo path, file selection, on-disk layout, final verification) lives in
/// `Configuration.parakeet()` / `Configuration.whisperKit(variant:)`; the download
/// machinery is shared.
///
/// Issue #449 moved the bytes themselves out of this class. What is left here is what
/// only this class knows — which repository, which files, which revision, and what a
/// finished download has to look like — and the transfer belongs to
/// `BackgroundModelDownloadService`, which owns one background `URLSession` for the
/// whole app. The delegate-based `downloadTask` this file used to run was foreground
/// only: leaving Dictus suspended it, the 30 s stall detector fired on the user's
/// return, and the retry started the current file at byte zero. On a 445 MB weight blob
/// that meant onboarding never finished unless the user stared at it.
///
/// Parity contracts to re-check on dependency bumps:
/// - FluidAudio 0.12.4 `DownloadUtils.downloadRepo` (file selection + layout) so that
///   `AsrModels.load` finds the cached files and goes straight to CoreML compilation.
///   Since issue #252 nothing downloads Parakeet on the load path, so a file this
///   downloader misses is a hard failure rather than a silent second download.
/// - WhisperKit `WhisperKit.download` / HubApi snapshot layout
///   (`Documents/huggingface/models/{repo}/{variant}`) so that
///   `WhisperKitConfig(modelFolder:)` and `ModelManager.deleteModel` keep working.
