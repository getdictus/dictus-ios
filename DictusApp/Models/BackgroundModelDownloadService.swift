// DictusApp/Models/BackgroundModelDownloadService.swift
// The one background URLSession that moves model bytes, and the state machine over it.
import Foundation
import DictusCore

/// Transfers model repository files in a background `URLSession`, one aligned byte
/// range at a time, and keeps a durable record of how far it got.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #449). Until it, the download was a foreground-only
/// `URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral` session created per file, and its retry restarted
/// the current file from byte zero. A user who left Dictus during
/// `Encoder.mlmodelc/weights/weight.bin` — 445 MB of Parakeet's 483 MB payload — had the
/// transfer suspended with the process, met the 30 s stall detector on their return, and
/// watched the bar go back to 0%. Measured on a 15 Pro Max on 2026-08-28: three attempts,
/// 98 MB then 289 MB then the whole thing, and the only one that finished was the one
/// where the user did not touch their phone for four minutes.
///
/// Three things had to change together, and none of them works without the other two:
///
/// 1. **A background session.** `URLSessionConfiguration.background` transfers keep
///    running while the process is suspended and are handed back to the app when it
///    returns, so leaving Dictus stops costing anything.
/// 2. **Chunks instead of whole files.** A `URLSessionDownloadTask` writes to a temp
///    file the system owns and only reveals in `didFinishDownloadingTo`, which fires on
///    success alone — so the bytes of a whole-file task that never finished are
///    unreachable. Fixed 32 MB aligned ranges are moved out of that temp location the
///    moment each one lands, which is what makes progress durable rather than merely
///    in flight.
/// 3. **A manifest.** The chunk that is safe to ask for next is a fact about the disk,
///    and it has to survive the process to be worth anything. `ModelDownloadManifest`
///    holds it, alongside the exact repository revision the bytes came from.
///
/// WHY HTTP RANGE AND NOT `URLSession` RESUME DATA. The issue's implementation direction
/// asked for resume data first and byte ranges as the fallback. Resume data cannot carry
/// acceptance criterion 3 — force-quit Dictus mid-file, relaunch, keep the bytes. iOS
/// cancels a background session's tasks when the user force-quits and does not relaunch
/// the app, and resume data is only ever handed to a *running* process through
/// `didCompleteWithError`. A process that was killed receives nothing and has nothing to
/// resume from. The maintainer's own follow-up note on the issue specifies the range path
/// in full and never mentions resume data, so that is what is built here; the two are
/// deliberately not mixed, because resume data replays a request with a `Range` header of
/// its own and the interaction with ours is not something anyone should have to reason
/// about at 2 am.
///
/// WHAT IT NEVER DOES: compile. A model that finishes downloading while Dictus is in the
/// background is left downloaded, and the Core ML prewarm waits for the foreground.
/// Issues #427 and #428 measured what an abandoned compile is worth in a suspended
/// process — nothing, and sometimes the process.
