// Plays short WAV sounds at key dictation lifecycle events using AudioToolbox.
import AudioToolbox

/// Plays audio feedback for dictation recording events (start, stop, cancel).
///
/// WHY AudioServicesPlaySystemSound (not AVAudioPlayer):
/// AudioServicesPlaySystemSound is the only API that respects the physical silent switch
/// on iPhone natively. AVAudioPlayer ignores it unless you manually check the ring/silent
/// switch state (which has no public API). Using AudioToolbox means: sound plays when
/// the phone is not on silent, and stays silent when the user has flipped the switch --
/// exactly the behavior users expect from feedback sounds.
///
/// WHY static cached sounds:
/// AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID has a ~2-5ms overhead per call (reads file from disk,
/// registers with the system). By caching the SystemSoundID after the first play, subsequent
/// plays are instant. The cache persists for the app's lifetime -- these IDs are cheap
/// (just an integer handle) and there are at most 29 of them.
///
/// WHY enum with static methods (same pattern as HapticFeedback):
/// Consistency with the existing DictusCore HapticFeedback enum. Both are stateless
/// utility types with class-level state (generators for haptics, cached IDs for sounds).
