// DictusApp/Audio/RawAudioCapture.swift

// Used during cold start to record audio while WhisperKit loads in parallel.

/// Lightweight audio capture that starts in <100ms without WhisperKit.
///
/// WHY this exists:
/// WhisperKit takes 3-4s to initialize on cold start. During that time, the user
/// is waiting with no recording happening. RawAudioCapture uses a plain AVAudioEngine
/// to start recording immediately. The captured samples are later passed to
/// WhisperKit's `transcribe(audioArray:)` once it finishes loading.
///
/// WHY a separate AVAudioEngine (not WhisperKit's AudioProcessor):
/// WhisperKit's AudioProcessor requires a fully initialized WhisperKit instance.
/// We need to capture audio BEFORE WhisperKit exists. This engine is stopped
/// before WhisperKit's warmUp() to avoid two engines running simultaneously.
