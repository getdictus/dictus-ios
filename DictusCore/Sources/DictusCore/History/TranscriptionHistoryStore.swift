// DictusCore/Sources/DictusCore/History/TranscriptionHistoryStore.swift
// The saved dictations (#70): one JSON file in the App Group, loaded once.
import Foundation
import SwiftUI

/// Every dictation the user has made, newest first.
///
/// ### Why a JSON file and not SwiftData (#70, brief decision 1)
///
/// The repo has no persistence framework, and everything shared already goes
/// through the App Group container. SwiftData would add a model container, a
/// schema and a migration path for what is a flat list of at most a few hundred
/// short records, and it would have to be taught to live in a shared container so
/// the keyboard can read it later (premium search, #216).
///
/// ### Why DictusCore and not DictusApp
///
/// So the keyboard extension can read it later without a second implementation.
/// **It does not write it in this issue** — every mutation below runs in DictusApp,
/// which is also the only process that transcribes. That single-writer property is
/// what lets this file skip `NSFileCoordinator`, unlike `PolishEventStore`, which
/// really does have two writers. A second writer arriving later has to revisit this
/// paragraph, not just add a call.
///
/// ### Load once, write whole
///
/// `records` is the truth for the lifetime of the process; the file is read once,
/// in `init`, and rewritten in full on every mutation. At the cap that is 200 short
/// strings — cheap enough that the alternative (an append-only journal plus
/// compaction, which is what `PolishEventStore` needs for its two writers) buys
/// nothing here. The write is atomic, so a process killed mid-write leaves the
/// previous file rather than a truncated one.
///
/// WHY the read is eager and not deferred to the first access: `records` is
/// `@Published`, so it has to be a stored property, and a lazy load would have to
/// be triggered by something other than reading it — which means every reader,
/// SwiftUI bodies included, has to remember to call it first. One of them will not.
///
/// ### Privacy
///
/// This is a plaintext record of everything the user has ever dictated. It never
/// leaves the device — no cloud, no sync, no export in this issue — and Settings
/// carries a destructive row that empties it (brief decision 3). Audio is never
/// stored, and there is no path to it from here.
///
/// ### The entitlement gates growth, never removal
///
/// The history is a Pro feature (`HistoryAvailability`), so `append` refuses
/// without the entitlement and **nothing is stored for a non-subscriber** — not
/// stored and hidden, not stored at all.
///
/// `delete`, `delete(atOffsets:)`, `clear` and `updateText` are deliberately NOT
/// gated. A lapsed subscription must not imprison the data: whatever is already on
/// disk stays deletable by its owner for as long as it exists. Expressing that as
/// "the gate is on the one method that grows the file" makes it a property of the
/// type rather than a rule four call sites have to remember.
///
/// WHY the gate is here and not in `DictationHandoff`: `append` is the single point
/// every dictation of either origin passes, which is what
/// `SmartModeStore.resolveArmedMode()` is for #395's entitlement. A gate at the
/// call sites would be two copies today and would miss the third caller written
/// next year.
