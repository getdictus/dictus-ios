// DictusCore/Sources/DictusCore/StatusMessageLifetime.swift
// How long the keyboard's toolbar message stays up, and which pending clear is
// allowed to take it down.

import Foundation

/// Identity for the toolbar's status message, so a clear scheduled for one message
/// can never take down the one that replaced it (#342).
///
/// ### The failure this exists for
///
/// Every status message used to schedule an unconditional clear three seconds out:
///
/// ```swift
/// assignStatusMessage(errorMsg, reason: "appError")
/// DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3) { [weak self] in
///     self?.assignStatusMessage(nil, reason: "appError-timeout")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// That closure clears whatever is on the toolbar when it fires, not the message it
/// was scheduled for. Two dictations failing two seconds apart is enough to see it,
/// and two mic taps are enough to produce that -- both attempts fail on "recording
/// too short". The second message inherits the remainder of the first one's timer and
/// dies after a second, observed on device on `1.8.0 (25)`:
///
/// ```
/// [13:42:27Z] KBD dictationMessageCleared reason=replaced displayedCount=3
/// [13:42:27Z] KBD dictationMessageSet reason=appError owner=952A01A2 visible=true
/// [13:42:28Z] KBD dictationMessageCleared reason=appError-timeout displayedCount=0
/// ```
///
/// The cost is not cosmetic. Two failures in a row are rarely the same failure twice:
/// the first is usually the cheap one the user caused, the second the one that needs
/// an action from them ("no model downloaded", "microphone unavailable"). Losing the
/// second loses the informative one. It also manufactures `displayedCount=0`, which
/// #261 defined as the signal that a message was never seen and mapped to `.warning`
/// so an agent reading an exported log can find it -- noise in the one channel built
/// to answer that question (#255).
///
/// ### Why a token rather than a cancellable work item
///
/// Holding the pending `DispatchWorkItem` and cancelling it before scheduling the next
/// one has fewer moving parts, but it only works while every future message source
/// remembers to route through the cancelling funnel. A token is checked by the clear
/// itself, so a message assigned by a site that has never heard of any of this still
/// invalidates the clears that came before it.
///
/// Lives in DictusCore because the keyboard extension has no test bundle, so a rule
/// left there is unprovable. Same reasoning as `TranscribingStageHold`,
/// `DictationSessionGeneration` and `KeyboardAreaMode`.
public struct StatusMessageLifetime: Equatable, Sendable {

    /// How long a status message stays on the toolbar.
    ///
    /// WHY one constant for every message: the two sites that raise one used to carry
    /// their own three seconds, one as a literal and one as a named constant, and they
    /// cross-cleared each other precisely because they were the same length by accident
    /// rather than by construction.
    ///
    /// Whether three seconds is the right number, whether the message should be
    /// dismissible, and whether some failures deserve no message at all, are #313's
    /// questions. This is the place that number lives, not a judgement about it.

    /// and neither does any clear scheduled for it.

    /// What a clear that has come due should do.
    ///
    /// ### Why three answers and not two (#490)
    ///
    /// `displayDuration` was being spent on wall clock, and a recording spends wall
    /// clock without showing the toolbar: the recording overlay owns the keyboard
    /// area for its whole length. Captured on device on 2026-09-04 — a Smart Mode
    /// refusal at 13:52:24, the user starting over at 13:52:26, the message cleared
    /// at 13:52:27 by its own timer while nobody could see it. Two of its three
    /// seconds went to a screen it was not on.
    ///
    /// So a clear that comes due during a dictation declines and asks to be
    /// rescheduled. **The number is unchanged** — whether three seconds is right is
    /// #313's question, not this type's — what changes is that it now measures time
    /// the message could actually be read.
    ///
    /// This cannot strand a message. A dictation is bounded by the keyboard's
    /// watchdog, and every route back to idle already takes the message down:
    /// an insertion, a cancel, a reconcile, or the next message replacing it.
