// DictusCore/Sources/DictusCore/AutocorrectDebugLog.swift
// Debug-only autocorrect instrumentation.
// The ENTIRE body of this file is wrapped in #if DEBUG — in Release builds,
// nothing below exists in the binary. The API is also no-op by default in
// Debug builds until the user toggles SharedKeys.autocorrectDebugLogging.
//
// WHY this is separate from LogEvent:
// LogEvent is privacy-safe by design — cases like keyboardTextInserted have NO
// content parameter. Adding events that log user-typed text would break that
// invariant. AutocorrectDebugLog is the explicit, quarantined exception:
// it logs user text ONLY in Debug builds ONLY when explicitly enabled.

import Foundation

/// Debug-only logger for autocorrect decisions. Release builds contain no code.
///
/// WHY #if DEBUG around the whole type:
/// Xcode sets the DEBUG flag automatically for the Run/Debug configuration
/// (dev builds via Run button) but NOT for Release/Archive configuration
/// (TestFlight + App Store submissions). This guarantees zero risk of user
/// text being logged in shipped builds — the code physically does not exist
/// in the production binary. There is no runtime flag that can override this.
