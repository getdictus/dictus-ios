// The deterministic text pass that IS the custom-vocabulary feature (#80).
import Foundation

/// Rewrites the engine's variants into the user's canonical spellings.
///
/// ### Why a text pass and not engine biasing (#80 decision 1)
///
/// The issue measured both purpose-built mechanisms and rejected both. WhisperKit
/// 0.16.0 exposes no `initialPrompt` — only raw `promptTokens`, capped at 111 tokens
/// and mutually exclusive with the prefill cache we enable at both production sites.
/// Parakeet, which is the recommended engine on any iPhone with 6 GB or more, does
/// ship `configureVocabularyBoosting` — but its judge is
/// `FluidInference/parakeet-ctc-110m-coreml`, which declares `["en"]` while our TDT
/// speaks 25 languages, and its stopword list is hardcoded English. On a French
/// dictation both sides of that rescorer would be scored by a model that has never
/// heard French.
///
/// A text replacement after transcription is the only stage that treats every
/// user's language and every device alike. It cannot recover a term the engine never
/// heard — it is a rewrite, not a recognition — and that boundary is the issue's
/// first decision.
///
/// ### Where it runs
///
/// At the consumer of `TranscriptionService.transcribe()`, in `DictationCoordinator`
/// — never inside `transcribe`, which returns from more than one branch depending on
/// the engine. That single point is upstream of both the in-app tail and the
/// keyboard hand-off, so one call serves both processes.
///
/// It runs **before** `VerbalPunctuationPrepass`, so a spoken punctuation command
/// sitting inside a term cannot split it before it is matched, and **before** the
/// polish, so nothing rewrites text that has already passed `PolishGuardrail` —
/// which is the class of defect #414 and #466 closed.

    ///
    /// ### Why this scans to a fixed point rather than once
    ///
    /// **A single scan is not idempotent, and the issue requires that it is.** The
    /// counter-example is CodeRabbit's, verified here on 2026-09-10, and it is in a
    /// *spaced* script — which is what an earlier version of this comment got wrong:
    /// with `fuu → foo` and `foo bar → baz`, the input `fuu bar` becomes `foo bar` on
    /// the first application and `baz` on the second.
    ///
    /// The rule-build filter below cannot see it. It refuses a needle that occurs
    /// inside a canonical *term*, and `foo bar` occurs inside neither `foo` nor
    /// `baz`. It appears only once `foo` has been emitted **next to the text that
    /// followed it**, and no inspection of the rules in isolation reaches that.
    ///
    /// So the pass scans until the text stops changing, which makes its result a
    /// fixed point and therefore idempotent by construction. The observable
    /// consequence is that chained rules now compose: the user gets `baz`, which is
    /// what their two rules say together.
    ///
    /// ### And when it does not settle
    ///
    /// **The transcript is returned untouched.** That keeps idempotence total rather
    /// than nearly-total — a text this refuses to rewrite is returned unchanged
    /// again on the next call — and refusing to rewrite is the conservative failure:
    /// the user keeps their own words, which is the same floor the polish guardrail
    /// falls back to. The filters below make a genuine loop hard to construct; this
    /// is what makes "hard" unnecessary to rely on.

    /// on every pass, and `foo` → `bar` beside `bar` → `foo` flips it. With those
    /// dropped, the image of the map meets its domain only at fixed points, so a
    /// second application changes nothing.
    ///

    /// between an emitted term and the text that follows it — `foo bar` appearing
