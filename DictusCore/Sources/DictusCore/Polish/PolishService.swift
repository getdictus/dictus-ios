/// 1. Honour the global toggle (`SharedKeys.polishEnabled`) — unless a Smart Mode
///    is armed, which is a narrower and later instruction (#79, `PolishGatePolicy`).
/// 2. Branch on the resolved prompt selection (#239): per-language path for
///    follow/explicit modes, language-agnostic auto path for Auto-detect.
/// 3. Detect the language of the raw STT output via `NLLanguageRecognizer`;
///    skip on gibberish (top hypothesis below `confidenceThreshold`).
/// 4. Choose the task: the armed Smart Mode when there is one, otherwise
///    `.natural` for Whisper or `.natural`/`.repair` for Parakeet depending on
///    detected-vs-target match, and `.auto` in Auto-detect mode.
/// 5. Run the engine with cancellation support, apply the task's acceptance

/// extension for a keyboard dictation, DictusApp for one started inside the app
/// (decision 4). Both instantiate one of these.
///
/// That is not only a code-sharing convenience — `availabilityGate` below is
/// per-process by nature, because the rate limit it tracks is. A gate living in the
/// app could say nothing true about the keyboard's budget, and vice versa
/// (decision 11).
