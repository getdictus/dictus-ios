/// ### Why one value instead of two parameters
///
/// A prompt and the contract its output is judged against must not be able to
/// disagree. Threading a `PolishMode` and an optional `SmartMode` side by side
/// through the pipeline would make that a convention every call site has to keep;
/// carrying one value makes it structural — there is no way to run Notes' prompt and
/// then judge its output against the faithful-polish band, because the band comes
/// off the same value the prompt did.
///
/// It is also what makes the session cache key identifier-based, which #79 asks for:
/// `AppleFoundationModelsPolishEngine` keyed its `LanguageModelSession` cache on
/// `(PolishMode, SupportedLanguage)`, and a mode that is a record has no enum case to
/// key on.

    /// The imperative that opens the user turn.

    /// Per task since #79. `AppleFoundationModelsPolishEngine` hardcoded the polish
    /// framing around every input, and asking the model to condense under an
    /// instruction that says "polish" is self-defeating.
    ///
    /// ### The wording of this string is load-bearing, and it was measured
    ///
    /// **Name the transformation, never the artefact.** The Email harness run
    /// (PR #388) held the instructions constant and swapped only this string:
    /// under `Polish this text. Output only the polished version, nothing else.`,
    /// zero hallucinated openers, closers or names in 190 calls; under
    /// `Rewrite this dictation as the body of an email`, 6 in 40 — including a
    /// literal `[Votre Nom]` from a prompt whose instructions explicitly banned
    /// `[Your Name]`, `[Nom]` and `[Signature]`.
    ///
    /// The mechanism is the model's genre prior: naming a written genre in the user
    /// turn pulls in that genre's furniture, and an instruction-level ban does not
    /// stop it. So every mode's framing follows the shape measured at zero —
    /// *"\<verb\> this text. Output only the \<result\>, nothing else."* — and none
    /// of them names a document type. That is why the Notes mode's framing says
    /// "condense into a bulleted list" and never the word "notes", which is a genre
    /// with a title line, headers and section names of its own.
    ///
    /// A new mode copies the shape. If it needs a placeholder guard, match the
    /// bracket **shape** `[…]`, not a vocabulary: banning `[Your Name]` is what
    /// produced `[Votre Nom]`.
    public var userInstruction: String {

    /// The user turn the engine sends: the imperative, the input, and the trailing
    /// marker.
    ///
    /// Without this framing Apple FM treats the raw as a conversational turn and
    /// emits chat-reply acknowledgements ("I'll polish it for you") instead of the
    /// transformed text.
    ///
    /// ### There is no `Input:` label, and that is the fix for #518
    ///
    /// This framing used to put the transcript under a literal `Input:` line. That
    /// one label made Apple FM refuse ordinary French with
    /// `unsupportedLanguageOrLocale` — a language it supports, read by our own
    /// `NLLanguageRecognizer` as `fr 1.000`, rejected at the session boundary in
    /// 3–18 ms before any generation ran. Measured on the two committed fixtures
    /// (`fixtures/refusal-fr.json`), five runs each, shipping system prompt:
    ///
    /// | user turn | refused |
    /// | --- | --- |
    /// | with `Input:`, own line (what shipped) | **10/10** |
    /// | with `Input:`, same line as the text | **10/10** |
    /// | with `Input:`, trailing marker removed | **10/10** |
    /// | no label (this) | 0/10 |
    /// | `Texte :` instead of `Input:` | 0/10 |
    /// | `<TRANSCRIPT>` tags (#474) | 0/10 |
    /// | no framing at all | 0/10, and it re-admits chat replies |
    ///
    /// So the trigger is **an English label immediately preceding the transcript**,
    /// not English framing in general: the imperative above stays in English in
    /// every passing variant. The trailing marker is not implicated — removing it
    /// alone leaves the refusal at 10/10 — so it stays, because it is the half that
    /// was measured to hold the chat replies back.
    ///
    /// Sending the transcript bare is what the classifier likes best and is still
    /// not an option: with no framing at all, "Je me dis est-ce que je pourrais"
    /// came back as *"Oui, je peux vous aider avec ça."*

    /// #474 will replace the blank line below with `<TRANSCRIPT>` tags across all
    /// eleven prompts at once. It measures as a fix here too; it is not landed here
    /// because tagging the user turn without tagging the eleven system prompts is
    /// the half-tagged state that issue's first criterion forbids.
    ///
    /// WHY it lives on the task rather than inside the engine: the #268 spike sends
    /// these exact bytes to a Core ML model outside the engine's process, and it
    /// briefly had a hand-copy of the framing — which would silently measure a
    /// different prompt the moment either side changed. It is also pure string
    /// composition with no availability gate, unlike the engine that sends it.
