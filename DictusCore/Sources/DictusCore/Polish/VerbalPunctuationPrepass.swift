/// Deterministic regex substitution of verbal punctuation commands.
///
/// Runs BEFORE the polish engine sees the text. Round 3 on-device testing showed
/// Apple FM applies verbal-punctuation rules reliably in English but never in
/// French — re-stating the rule as a "mandatory exception" in the prompt didn't
/// move the needle. The behavior is a floor of the model, not a prompt-tuning
/// problem.
///
/// Since verbal punctuation is a deterministic transformation anyway (no
/// language understanding required), doing it in regex bypasses Apple FM
/// entirely for this concern. Apple FM still handles the rest of Light:
/// capitalisation, typographic spacing, accents.
///
/// Scope at round 1: French and English. Spanish/German added in step 7.
///
/// Known false positives: literal references to punctuation ("ma virgule est
/// cassée") become substitutions. Accepted — the dictation use case is
/// dominant in practice.
///
/// EXCLUDED ON PURPOSE — the bare sentence-period word (#185): French "point"
/// and English "period" are NOT in the rules. Unlike every other command they
/// are extremely common ordinary words ("un point de vue", "faire le point", "à
/// quel point" / "a period of time", "period drama"), and being single short
/// tokens they offer no multi-word context to disambiguate. Converting them
/// silently corrupts the sentence ("un point final" → "un. final"). We accept
/// the cost of dropping them because the LLM already supplies the terminal
/// period at natural sentence boundaries on its own (observed on device). The
/// unambiguous multi-word marks that merely CONTAIN "point" ("point
/// d'interrogation", "point d'exclamation", "point virgule") stay. The same
/// principle pre-emptively bars Spanish "punto" and German "Punkt" when those
/// languages get rules. Revisit once the LLM owns punctuation contextually.
