/// killed that assumption: an app kill (deliberate, or iOS terminating a
/// backgrounded extension host) wipes every event Pierre is trying to ship for
/// analysis — defeating the iteration loop. Persisting locally matches what

///
/// ### Two writers, one destructive owner (#361 decision 8)
///
/// Since polish moved into the keyboard, both processes append here. Only DictusApp
/// prunes, rewrites, clears and exports, so every destructive operation stays
/// single-writer and the concurrency story does not change. The keyboard's whole
/// interaction with this file is `append`, which deliberately does not bootstrap:
/// a read of the seven-day window would pull the entire file into a process living
/// under a ~50 MB ceiling, which is the one thing the extension cannot afford.
///
/// Appends go through `NSFileCoordinator`, for the reason `PersistentLog` does:
/// `FileHandle(forWritingTo:)` seeks and writes as two steps, and two processes
/// doing that on the same file can interleave a line into the middle of another.
///
/// Privacy stance: `raw` and `polished` are user dictation text. They never
/// leave the device — the file lives in the App Group container, and the
/// export-to-share flow is explicitly user-triggered. Behavior is identical to
/// `PersistentLog`, which already stores transcription metadata in the same
/// container.
