/// What one polish task will accept back from the engine.
///
/// ### Why this had to stop being a property of `PolishMode`
///
/// `PolishGuardrail` was bound to the faithful-polish contract of ADR 0003 and ran
/// on the output whatever prompt produced it. Two of its rules break a Smart Mode by
/// construction: the `0.5...2.0` length band rejects Notes, which condenses on
/// purpose, and the output-must-match-the-target language check rejects every
/// translation. So the contract travels with the task instead of being looked up
/// from a global table (#79).
///
/// ### The length band is a backstop, not a guard
///
/// It catches catastrophic over- and under-generation — an empty answer, a runaway.
/// It does not catch a bad transformation. Measured on the Email harness run
/// (PR #388): the Natural band of `0.5...2.0` rejected **nothing in 240 calls**,
/// including outputs carrying an invented greeting and signature that accounted for
/// roughly a quarter of the added length.
///
/// So do not size a new mode's band as though it were protecting anything, and do
/// not let a wide band read as a weakened contract — the check that actually guards
/// a mode is `outputLanguage`. If a mode needs a real guard, it has to be a real
/// one.
///
/// The bands below are judgement calls sized against what each transformation does
/// to length, not measurements. They are the first thing to revisit if the harness
/// shows a mode's own output being rejected.

    /// Whether every person, place and organisation the output names has to appear
    /// in the input already (#414).
    ///
    /// ### Why a mode has to answer this
    ///
    /// The check is only sound where the output stays in the input's own language
    /// **and** the transformation is not licensed to replace words:
    ///
    /// - **A translation localises names.** `Londres` becomes `London`. Surface
    ///   identity is not expected, so the check would be measuring the wrong thing.
    /// - **Repair reconstructs words by design** (ADR 0002): its contract is
    ///   substituting what the speaker probably meant for what the STT emitted,
    ///   which can legitimately produce a name the raw does not carry.
    ///
    /// ### Why a field rather than a derivation
    ///
    /// `outputLanguage` happens to discriminate the translation case today, and
    /// deriving from it would work for this catalogue — the same argument
    /// `SmartModeOverflowBehaviour` answers, with the same conclusion. A custom mode
    /// (#269) must *answer* the question rather than inherit an answer from a
    /// property chosen for an unrelated reason, and a mode that condenses *and*
    /// reconstructs would break the derivation silently. It cannot break an answer
    /// someone had to write down.

    /// ### Why a mode has to answer this

    /// The prefix-alignment check is only sound where the output reuses the input's
    /// own words, in the input's own order. Three tasks answer `false`:
    ///
    /// - **List restructures.** It condenses a rambling dictation into bullets that
    ///   synthesise, so the first bullet need not come from the first sentence.
    /// - **Translation keeps no word of the input.** There is no lexical overlap to
    ///   look for anywhere, let alone at the head.
    /// - **Repair reconstructs in another language** (ADR 0002).
    ///   `PolishPipeline.mode` selects it exactly when the detected language differs
    ///   from the target, so its output shares no vocabulary with its input by
    ///   construction. #466's scope put repair in scope and the corpus overruled it:
    ///   **10 of 10 legitimate repair outputs refused, at every pair in the sweep.**
    ///
    /// ADR 0003 puts reordering on Natural's forbidden list and `.auto` carries the
    /// same light-corrections-only contract, so those two answer `true`.
    ///
    /// ### Why a field rather than a derivation
    ///
    /// The same argument `requiresGroundedNames` records. A custom mode (#269) must
    /// *answer* the question rather than inherit an answer from a property chosen
    /// for an unrelated reason — and the property that would carry the derivation
    /// today, `outputLanguage`, gets List wrong: it says `.sameAsInput`, which is
    /// true and has nothing to do with order.
