/// else."* around every input. Asking a model to produce notes under an instruction
/// that says "polish" is self-defeating, so the framing became per-mode (#79).

/// What a mode puts on the mic pill's corner badge when it is armed (#79).
///
/// ### Why this is not just `icon`
///
/// The badge is an 18 pt disc and the only thing on screen while the user types, so
/// it has to answer "which mode" on its own — the fan and the centre label are both
/// gone by then. A symbol answers that for Notes. It does not for Translate: the
/// glyph is a globe, and **a globe is the same globe whatever the target language**.
/// The moment a user pins → EN and → ES, which is the point of pinning three modes,
/// two identical badges mean two different transformations. The target's code does
/// not have that problem and is two characters wide.
///
/// It stays separate from `displayName` because the name is sized for a fan row —
/// "→ EN" with its arrow — and the arrow is noise inside a disc that is already
/// attached to the button it modifies.
public enum SmartModeBadge: Equatable, Sendable, Codable {

    /// An SF Symbol, for modes a glyph can name.
    case symbol(String)

    /// One or two characters, for modes that a glyph cannot tell apart.
    case text(String)
}

/// What the user receives when a mode's transformation is refused and **nothing the
/// engine produced can reach the document** — a context overflow (#270) or a
/// guardrail rejection (#580).
///
/// ### Why this is not simply the fail-closed rule
///
/// `PolishTask.isSmart` states the rule the rest of the pipeline follows: a Smart
/// Mode must never silently insert untransformed text, so a refusal inserts nothing.
/// That rule exists to stop a *wrong transformation* reaching the document. Two
/// non-successes carry no such risk, for the same reason by two different routes:
///
/// - `.exceededContextBudget` is decided before the engine is called, so no
///   transformation was ever attempted.
/// - `.rejectedGuardrail` throws the engine's output away whole. What is inserted in
///   its place is `preprocessed` — the transcript with the verbal-punctuation
///   pre-pass applied, a deterministic function of the user's own words. Nothing
///   that half-happened can reach the document.
///
/// In both, the risk is absent by construction and what the user loses by refusing
/// is the same thing: the structuring, not the words. And the cost of refusing
/// anyway is not symmetrical:
///
/// - **List** overflows at roughly 4,500-4,900 characters, and List is precisely
///   the mode built for a long rambling dictation. Refusing costs the user the whole
///   text; inserting the deterministic floor costs them the bullets. Same language,
///   same content, just not restructured. #580 measured the guardrail half of this
///   on `Structured`: 9 runs, 3 refused, one of them 1,337 characters of ordinary
///   French that the user dictated for two minutes and never saw again.
/// - **Translate → X** cannot degrade at all. The floor *is* the wrong language, so
///   inserting it is the exact scenario #79 names as the worst available: French
///   sent to an American client, with a transient toolbar line as the only warning.
///
/// Both cases show a message; neither is silent. That is what made this block B's
/// decision rather than something block A could have inherited (#79, 2026-08-24).
///
/// ### What this field does NOT license
///
/// `.engineFailed` and `.cancelled` are partial generations — something may have
/// half-happened — and `.engineUnavailable` describes a process that will not call
/// the model again for its lifetime, which is a different conversation to have with
/// the user (#315). `.unsupportedInputLanguage` (#490) never reached the engine
/// either, yet stays closed too: its floor is text in a language the model cannot
/// read, so "at least the words are there" is not the offer it is here. All four
/// ignore this field. The gate is in `PolishPipeline.degradesToFloor`.
///
/// ### Why a field rather than a derivation
///
/// `PolishAcceptanceContract.outputLanguage` already discriminates the two cases
/// today — `.fixed(_)` cannot degrade, `.sameAsInput` can — and deriving it would
/// work for this catalogue. It is a field so that a custom mode (#269) has to answer
/// the question rather than inherit an answer from a property chosen for an
/// unrelated reason. A mode that condenses *and* translates would break the
/// derivation silently; it cannot break an answer someone had to write down.
///
/// **Named `SmartModeOverflowBehaviour` until #580**, when the guardrail case joined
/// the overflow one and the old name stopped describing the question. The raw values
/// are unchanged, and so is the JSON key the record is written under — see
/// `SmartMode.CodingKeys`.
public enum SmartModeFloorBehaviour: String, Equatable, Sendable, Codable {

    /// Insert the deterministic floor — the raw text with verbal punctuation
    /// applied — and say the mode did not run.
    case insertRawText

    /// Insert nothing and say why. The floor would be wrong, not merely plainer.
    case insertNothing
}

/// One Smart Mode.
///
/// ### Data, not enum cases
///
/// A mode is a record — identifier, prompt, acceptance contract, display name,
/// icon, pinned flag. v1 ships built-ins only (`SmartModeCatalogue`), but they are
/// already records, so the custom-mode editor (#269) adds a row rather than forcing
/// a refactor, and the whole record can cross the App Group with the dictation it
/// governs.
///
/// ### What is persisted, and what is not
///
/// The *armed selection* persists as an identifier (`SmartModeStore`); the record
/// itself is rebuilt from the catalogue each time it is needed. That is deliberate:
/// persisting a built-in's prompt would freeze whichever version of it was current
/// when the user first armed the mode, and prompts are versioned with the binary.
///
/// The one place a whole record *is* written down is the per-dictation snapshot —
/// taken in DictusApp at transcription start and read by the keyboard extension,
/// which runs the engine since #361. It is a snapshot for exactly the reason
/// `TranscriptionLanguagePolicy` is one (#226): the user must not be able to change
/// the mode mid-transcription and have the transformation disagree with what was
/// transcribed. Re-reading the armed mode on the far side would reintroduce that in
/// the worst possible place, since the keyboard is where the mode is armed.
