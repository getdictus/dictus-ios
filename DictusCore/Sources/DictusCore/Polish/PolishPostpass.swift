/// Round 4 round-1 testing showed Apple Foundation Models has two
/// behavioural floors we cannot prompt-tune past:
///
/// 1. Raw `\n` characters in the input get "naturalised" into `, ` + capital
///    on output. The model interprets a newline as a sentence-boundary cue
///    and rewrites the boundary in prose form, no matter how the prompt
///    spells out "preserve newlines".
///
/// 2. The model never inserts the U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE before `?`, `!`,
///    `;`, `:` even when the rule line says so and the examples literally
///    contain NBSP bytes. ASCII space and NBSP are indistinguishable to
///    its sampling.
///
/// Both are deterministic transformations — handling them in code is more
/// reliable than coaxing the model. The pre-engine `encodeForEngine` step
/// hides newlines behind a multi-char ASCII marker that survives the
/// round-trip; the post-engine `decodeFromEngine` step restores the
/// newlines and applies the French typographic spacing.
