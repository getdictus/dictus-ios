/// what counts as a confident disagreement; the length decides which segments are
/// long enough for a confidence to be worth reading at all. Raising one without the
/// other either fires on noise or stops firing entirely.
///
/// Both were measured, not chosen. Scored over 273 segments of 128 hand-labelled
/// outputs — every output the #393 campaign committed, plus an adversarial set for
/// the cases it does not contain. Reproduce with
/// `swift run polish-harness guardrail docs/research/413-414-guardrail/*.json --sweep`,
/// which drives no model.

///

/// near its top rather than its middle: a floor that is too high misses a drift,
/// which leaves today's behaviour; a floor that is too low refuses a good output,
/// which for a Smart Mode costs the user everything they said. Only 3 of 219

/// 2. `detectedLanguageMatches(polished:target:)` — language detection on the
///    polished output, whole **and per segment**. Catches chat-reply contamination
///    where Apple FM responds conversationally in a different language (e.g. "I'll
///    polish it for you" when the user dictated French), and since #413 also a list
///    that drifts one item at a time.
/// 3. `PolishGrounding` — whether the output is *about* the input. Lives in its own
///    type because it answers a different question with a different tool.
/// 4. `PolishGrounding.acceptsSegmentOverlap` — whether every LINE of the output is
///    made of the input's own words. The second query over the tokens check 3 uses,
///    and the one that sees a fabricated bullet naming nobody (#414). It shares
///    check 3's contract gate and names itself apart, because "the model invented a
///    person" and "the model invented a line" are two answers.
/// 5. `PolishPrefixAlignment` — whether the output *opens* where the input opens.
///    Catches the chat reply that arrives in the RIGHT language, which check 2
///    cannot see by construction: a preamble (#466) and a refusal (#349), both of

    /// same French fixture and one bullet apart:
    ///
    /// | output | whole-output reading | verdict then |
    /// |---|---|---|
    /// | 6 bullets, wholly English | English, 0.607 | rejected ✅ |
    /// | 5 English bullets + 1 French | **French, 0.789** | **accepted** ❌ |
    ///
    /// The second is the more broken of the two for a French user and it is the one
    /// that got through, because the single French bullet, the proper nouns and the
    /// word "euros" carried the aggregate. Read line by line the same text is
    /// unambiguous: `fr 1.000`, then `en 0.992`, `en 0.988`, `en 0.908`, `en 0.961`,
    /// `en 0.999`.
    ///
    /// **Raising the confidence floor was never the fix**, and is recorded here so
    /// nobody re-proposes it: 0.789 is a *confident wrong* answer, so any floor low
    /// enough to be useful still accepts it.
    ///
    /// ### Both passes stay
    ///
    /// The whole-output pass is what catches a wholly-wrong single passage — the
    /// Apple FM chat reply this guardrail was written for — which has no segment
    /// structure to inspect. The per-segment pass only ever adds rejections; free
    /// polish, which returns one continuous passage, sees no change.
