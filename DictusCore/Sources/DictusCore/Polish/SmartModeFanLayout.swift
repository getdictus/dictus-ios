    /// travels away from the palm: the nearest row is the cheapest to reach, and

    /// frustration.
    ///
    /// The pinned list is capped defensively as well as at the store, because this
    /// is the side that cannot draw more.
    ///
    /// ### Why the armed mode is an input to a list it never appears in
    ///
    /// It decides whether a Normal-only fan is worth opening, and #402 is what
    /// happens when that question is answered somewhere else. With nothing pinned
    /// and nothing armed, a one-row fan is a menu with one item, no way to learn
    /// what the others are, and nothing to undo — the user is better served by
    /// being told where the mode list lives. With nothing pinned but a mode
    /// **armed**, that same one row is the only surface in the product that clears
    /// it: releasing back on the mic aborts, so the mic is not the way out. A user
    /// who unpins everything while "→ DE" is armed otherwise dictates German
    /// forever, which is the bug as Pierre hit it on device.
    ///
    /// ### Why an empty array rather than a second return type
    ///
    /// A fan with no rows is not a state `SmartModeFanState` is allowed to hold —
    /// its own doc comment says so — so "no rows" already means "do not open" for
    /// everything downstream, and `rowHeight` and `entryIndex` already answer 0 and
    /// nil for it. Wrapping that in an enum would name the same thing twice.
    ///
    /// `armed` is the resolved record, not the stored identifier: an identifier this
    /// build cannot resolve reads as nil, and refusing on it is right — that user is
    /// already getting Normal, so there is nothing to escape from.
    ///
    /// ### The non-subscriber's fan keeps the shape everyone else's has (#404)
    ///
    /// `Normal`, the default-pinned modes, and a `Dictus Pro` row — **four rows, the
    /// same four slots a subscriber sees**. A single full-height Dictus Pro row was
    /// built first, from #392's thread, and re-decided on device on 2026-08-29 for
    /// three reasons, of which the aesthetic one was the smallest:
    ///
    /// - **It removed the only way to dictate.** With one row there is no `Normal`,
    ///   so a non-subscriber who opened the fan could not start a recording from it
    ///   at all: releasing on the Pro row leaves for the app, releasing back on the
    ///   mic is the documented abort. A lost function, not a style preference.
    /// - **"Dictus Pro" advertises nothing.** `Liste` and `→ EN` greyed under their
    ///   real names say what the subscription buys; the product's own name does not.
    /// - **It was two different screens for one object.** Subscribing should
    ///   *un-grey* this fan, not replace it with a surface the user has to learn
    ///   twice.
    ///
    /// **It opens whatever is pinned or armed**, which is the decision #404 left open
    /// about #403's armed-mode-alone fan, and it is safe for the same reason it was
    /// when this was one row: a user without entitlement is *already* getting Normal,
    /// because `resolveArmedMode()` refuses to honour a mode without it (#395).
    /// #402's stranding needs a mode that is actually applying. The armed value
    /// survives untouched and comes back with the subscription — and now, unlike in
    /// the one-row shape, the `Normal` row is there to release on regardless.
    ///
    /// The no-dead-space rule below is untouched: rows still divide the area evenly
    /// and completely. It never required *one* row, only that the rows fill the area.
    ///
    /// The caller decides whether the offer is on, because it also owes the #236
    /// gate: while the paywall is hidden there is nothing to sell and a row leading
    /// to it is a dead end.
