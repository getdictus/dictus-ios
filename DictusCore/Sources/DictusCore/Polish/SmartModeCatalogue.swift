/// The catalogue of Smart Modes.
///
/// ### v1 ships two families, and Email is not one of them
///
/// **List** moves the text along the structure axis, **Translate → X** along the
/// language axis. SMS and Summary were cut in the design session: the free polish
/// already produces natural conversational text — that is literally the ADR 0003
/// `natural` contract — so an SMS mode would be the one paid mode whose output is
/// indistinguishable from the free one, and List already synthesises.
///
/// **Email is conditional and absent from this build.** Two independent
/// implementations fail the same way — they invent greetings and sign-offs the user
/// never dictated, with names the model cannot know — and #79 makes Email's
/// inclusion conditional on the harness showing it can change register and structure
/// while inventing neither. That validation is separate work. When it passes, Email
/// is a row in `builtIns` and a prompt file; nothing else has to move.
///
/// ### The list is data
///
/// Built-in rows are constructed here rather than persisted, so a prompt fix ships
/// with the binary instead of being frozen on every device that ever armed the mode.
/// What persists is the user's part: which mode is armed, and which are pinned
/// (`SmartModeStore`). Custom modes (#269) become a second source merged into `all`.

    /// for *Normal* polish and which this mode deliberately is not. `List` names the
