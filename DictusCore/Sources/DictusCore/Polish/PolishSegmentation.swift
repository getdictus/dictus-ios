/// Splits a polish output into the pieces a guardrail inspects individually.
///
/// ### Why this exists at all
///
/// Both guardrail holes #393 found are the same shape: a check that reads the whole
/// output as one blob cannot see a defect confined to one item of a list. #413's
/// language check reads an output of five English bullets and one French one as
/// French, because the aggregate is what `NLLanguageRecognizer` answers about.
/// #414's grounding check needs the same cut for a different reason — `NLTagger`'s
/// recall is context-sensitive, and it finds a name on a bullet standing alone that
/// it misses inside the block.
///
/// ### A segment is a line
///
/// After `PolishPostpass.decodeNewlines` every dictated and every model-emitted
/// break is a single `\n`, so one bullet is one line — this splits on the text the
/// post-pass already produced and changes nothing about how breaks are encoded,
/// decoded or emitted (#437 owns that).
///
/// Sentence-level segmentation was considered for that check and is not what ships
/// there. A sentence is short enough that the recogniser is unreliable on it, so the
/// check would spend its confidence floor on noise; and the failure #413 measured is
/// per *item*, not per sentence. Measured on the #393 corpus: lines clear every
/// pre-registered bar with room, and sentences buy nothing — see
/// `docs/research/413-414-guardrail-resolution.md` §6.
///
/// ### An input is cut by sentence, and that is not a contradiction (#456)
///
/// `sentences(of:)` below exists because the *input* asks a different question. A raw
/// STT transcript has no lines at all — Parakeet emits one continuous blob — so the
/// line cut returns a single segment there and measures nothing. And the question is
/// not "does any unit disagree", which is a refusal, but "how much of the text is in
/// each language", which is a count: a sentence that reads weakly contributes nothing
/// to the count instead of vetoing the whole text, so the unreliability that rules
/// sentences out of a guardrail is affordable in a proportion. See
/// `PolishLanguageMix`.
