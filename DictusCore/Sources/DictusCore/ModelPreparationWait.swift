// DictusCore/Sources/DictusCore/ModelPreparationWait.swift

// preparation screen shows about it. Issue #432.

/// How long the preparation screen should tell the user to expect to be there.
///
/// WHY a bucket and not just the number:
/// `ModelInfo.firstPreparationSeconds` is a measurement, and a measurement is not a
/// promise. Something has to decide whether to round 236 seconds up or down, whether
/// a 32-second wait deserves a figure at all, and what to say for a model nobody has
/// ever timed. Those decisions are the same wherever they are asked, they are the
/// part of this issue with a right and a wrong answer, and none of them can be tested
/// from inside a SwiftUI view. Making them here leaves the view with a `switch` it
/// cannot get wrong and leaves the reasoning somewhere a test can hold it still.
public enum ModelPreparationWait: Equatable, Sendable {

    /// Measured, and short enough that naming a number would be noise rather than
    /// reassurance. Medium's 32s.

    /// `minimumNamedMinutes`.

    /// does not know this identifier at all — which is exactly what a model left over

    /// (after each update, issue #542). It invents no duration.

    /// user wants the number.

    /// WHY a floor of two: the English source sentence reads "about %lld minutes" and
    /// the String Catalog carries no plural rule for it, so a 1 would ship "about 1
    /// minutes" into a screen the user is already staring at. Nothing in the catalogue
    /// is anywhere near that seam today — the two measured values are 32s and 236s —
    /// so the floor is here to stop a 70-second model added later from introducing the
    /// bug quietly. It costs at most a minute of overstatement, in the safe direction.

    /// quit. Issue #432 is that decision, taken by the maintainer, on a screen that
    /// named no duration at all. A wait that ends sooner than announced costs nothing;
    /// one that runs past the announced figure re-creates the exact doubt the sentence
    /// was written to remove, and now with the app's own words as evidence.
