// DictusCore/Sources/DictusCore/ToolbarCentreSlot.swift
// What the keyboard toolbar's centre slot shows, by priority (issues #79, #241, #266, #635, #639).
import Foundation

/// The one occupant of the toolbar's centre slot.
///
/// ### Why this is a value and not a chain of `if`s in the view
///
/// Six things compete for the same strip of the same 52 pt bar, arriving from six
/// different lifecycles — a dictation failing in another process, an insertion that
/// just landed, a keystroke, a rate limit that lasts the whole process, a setting
/// made last week, and a first-run hint. #79 specifies them as a priority table, and
/// a priority table written as nested branches in a SwiftUI body is a table nobody
/// can check. The keyboard extension has no test bundle; DictusCore does, which is
/// the same argument `KeyboardAreaMode` makes.
///
/// ### The order, and what each place is buying
///
/// 0. **Choosing a mode** — the fan is open under the user's thumb *right now*. It
///    outranks the error and the undo because both of those describe something that
///    already finished, and the bar is the only place left to title a menu that has
///    taken the keys: the fan itself cannot carry a header without pushing its rows
///    down, and the row positions are the arithmetic the release depends on.
/// 1. **Error** — the dictation failed. Nothing below it is worth saying, and undo
///    in particular is meaningless because nothing was inserted.
/// 2. **Undo** (#266) — expires in seconds and on the first keystroke, and it is the
///    only alternative to holding backspace on a two-minute dictation.
/// 3. **Suggestions** — the keyboard's core job, and the reason the left slot yields
///    at all (`ToolbarView` needs the width for three legible slots).
/// 3b. **Dictation unavailable** (#635) — a pre-A14 device, where the keyboard cannot
///    dictate at all. It takes the idle bar's place for as long as the keyboard is
///    open, because it explains the greyed mic beside it; it yields only to the
///    suggestions, which are the keyboard's core job and the one thing that still
///    works the same there. Every rung below it is about dictation (the polish
///    notice, the armed mode, the Smart Mode hint) and would describe a feature this
///    device does not have, so they never show. The one exception is the panel hint
///    (#639): it teaches the menu, which still works, and it retires itself after
///    the first long press, so it is allowed to win until then.
/// 4. **Polish unavailable** (#315) — not in #79's table, which predates it. It sits
///    here rather than higher because it can last the whole process, and above the
///    suggestions it would suppress completions for that entire time. It sits above
///    the two Smart Mode entries because when polish will not run, the armed mode
///    will not run either: naming the mode there would be advertising something the
///    process has already stopped doing.
/// 5. **Armed mode name** (#79) — a sticky setting the user made once, possibly
///    weeks ago, on a surface they only see when idle. Two cases at this rung, and
///    which one shows is decided by whether a dictation starting now would actually
///    honour it (#423): `armedMode` when it runs, `armedModeInactive` when it does
///    not. Same rung because it is the same fact — this is what you armed — and
///    demoting the inactive one would hide the very thing the user needs to see to
///    understand why their dictations changed.
/// 6. **Discovery hints** — cost nothing, because they only render when there is
///    nothing else at all to show. Two at this rung: the panel one (#639), which
///    teaches that the panel moved to a long press on ☰, and the Smart Mode one
///    (#79). When both apply the panel one wins: it answers a change the user has
///    just run into — the tap on ☰ opened the voice notes, not the languages —
///    where the Smart Mode one would say the same thing tomorrow.
///
/// #637 had a voice note **chip** at 3b, below the suggestions. #639 took it out:
/// the reader now opens from a tap on ☰, the ☰ carries the "something is waiting"
/// ring, and the slot went back to suggestions, undo and hints.
