/// WHY in DictusCore (not DictusWidgets):
/// Both DictusApp (to start/update the activity) and DictusWidgets (to render it)
/// need access to this type. DictusCore is the shared framework imported by both.
///
/// WHY no mutable attributes (only ContentState):
/// ActivityAttributes properties are set at creation time and never change.
/// Dictus has no per-activity metadata — the same app, same branding, same behavior.
/// All dynamic data lives in ContentState, updated via Activity.update().

    /// nesting is one more than the project lints for, and the type is the same
    /// type either way. Unqualified `Phase` still resolves from inside
