// The raw transcription, durable in the App Group while the keyboard polishes it (#361).
import Foundation

/// A transcription the keyboard has claimed and not yet typed.
///
/// ### The principle this exists for
///
/// **The raw transcription must be durable before any generation starts.** Polish
/// runs in the keyboard extension since #361, and the extension is a process iOS
/// may stop running at any moment. Writing the raw down first, and treating polish
/// as an enrichment applied on top, keeps the old worst case — the dictation
/// degrades to raw insertion — as the new worst case, rather than opening a new
/// class of loss.
///
/// ### And the failure it turned out to guard against
///
/// The measurement on 2026-08-23 (#361, #357 Q4) found the extension is not torn
/// down mid-generation. It is *suspended*, and that is worse: a generation dismissed
/// off-screen resumed and completed forty-four minutes later, and under a design
/// where the keyboard owns insertion it would have typed into whatever document held
/// focus at that moment. So `documentIdentifier` is not a nicety that saves a
/// dictation during iOS's routine controller churn — it is the primary guard against
/// a resurrected write. The question it answers is not "can this raw be recovered"
/// but "may this generation still be inserted".
///
/// Both readings need the same two facts, which is why they are on the same record.

    /// the user started under a different instruction. The whole record travels
    /// rather than its identifier so a custom mode (#269) needs no lookup table on
    /// the far side.

    /// raised before it is wiped by `KeyboardState.insertDictation` on its way to
    /// idle — and by then a newer dictation may already own the slot. This record is
    /// the thing that is superseded correctly.

    /// **It identifies an input session, not a document.** It is stable across the
    /// in-place controller churn decision 7 was written around — the ~9 rebuilds per
    /// dictation (#281) — which is why ordinary dictations insert normally. But
    /// dismissing the keyboard and re-presenting it mints a new one, *even in the same
    /// field of the same app*: three runs in that capture returned
    /// `different-document` (a non-nil identifier that did not match) at 4,860,
    /// 8,356 and 7,406 ms, after the maintainer left Notes and came straight back to

    /// not move" — it separates them only *within* one input session, and reads
    /// "left" across any dismissal whether or not the user came back.
    ///
    /// The half that matters survives intact: it is a sound guard against typing a
    /// resurrected generation into a document the user did not choose, which is the
    /// forty-three-minute case #357 Q4 measured. The maintainer tested the resulting
    /// behaviour deliberately and accepted it — the raw is on DictusApp's result card
    /// either way, and a user who leaves mid-polish can reasonably expect no text.

    /// check is what decides whether a late generation may be typed.

    /// of 12,528 ms over 196 successes (#315 export). 30 s clears that with margin
    /// while staying far under the five-minute App Group sweep that is the outer
    /// bound. A judgement call, not a measurement.

    /// pass first, and the scope finding recorded on `documentIdentifier` above means
