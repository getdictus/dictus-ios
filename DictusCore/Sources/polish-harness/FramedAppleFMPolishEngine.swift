// DictusCore/Sources/polish-harness/FramedAppleFMPolishEngine.swift
//
// Harness-only engine for #79. Identical to `AppleFoundationModelsPolishEngine`
// in every respect that the measurement depends on — same Apple Foundation
// Model, same `LanguageModelSession(instructions:)` wrapper, same one-call
// stateless lifecycle, same `PolishPipeline` around it — with ONE difference:
// the USER turn is supplied by the caller instead of being hardcoded.
//
// WHY this exists. The shipping engine hardcodes its user turn as
// "Polish this text. Output only the polished version, nothing else." That
// framing is correct for free polish and wrong for a Smart Mode: #79 says so
// itself — "asking the model to produce notes under an instruction that says
// 'polish' is self-defeating" — and lists making the framing per-mode as an
// engine change the feature has to make. `--instructions` overrides the SYSTEM
// prompt only, so without this file the harness can only measure an Email
// prompt underneath an instruction that says "polish", and round 2 produced
// direct evidence that the mismatch matters (the model emitted "voici la
// version polie du texte" and collapsed the register lift back toward free
// polish). Measuring the confound is cheaper than arguing about it.
//
// It deliberately does NOT touch the shipping engine: the Smart Modes pipeline
// is being built on another branch, and this is a measurement, not a step
// toward shipping. Whatever framing wins here is a finding for that branch to
// implement, not code it can import.
//
// Lives in the `polish-harness` target only — macOS-only, excluded from every
// app target and from CI.
