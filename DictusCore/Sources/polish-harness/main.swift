// DictusCore/Sources/polish-harness/main.swift
//
// Off-device polish eval harness. Runs the REAL pipeline (PolishPipeline +
// AppleFoundationModelsPolishEngine) on text fixtures, on a Mac with Apple
// Intelligence. The polish input is text (the `raw` field of a device export),
// so no audio is needed. NOT run by CI — Apple FM is non-deterministic and
// absent from CI runners.
//
// Usage:
//   swift run polish-harness show  <fixtures.json> [--runs N] [--instructions <prompt.txt>]
//   swift run polish-harness eval  <fixtures.json> [--instructions <prompt.txt>]
//   swift run polish-harness ab    <fixtures.json> [--a <promptA.txt>] [--b <promptB.txt>]
//
// `--lang <code>` (#439) reroutes every fixture in the file: "auto" sends a
// per-language set through the Auto-detect path, "fr" pins an auto set to French.
// Which path a dictation takes is a SETTING on the device, not a property of the
// text, so a fixture set that measures a prompt has to be runnable through both.
//
// `--instructions <file>` overrides the system prompt (A/B a candidate without
// recompiling). `ab` runs two sides side by side.
//
// `--mode <identifier>` (#393) runs an armed Smart Mode instead of the free polish:
// the mode's prompt, its per-mode user-turn framing, and — the part that cannot be
// inherited — its own acceptance contract. `ab` takes one per side (`--mode-a`,
// `--mode-b`), which is how a mode is compared against free polish rather than
// against another prompt file.
//
// SPIKE ADDITION (#268, throwaway): `--engine local --model <name> [--base-url <url>]`
// on `show` and `eval` runs the same pipeline against an OpenAI-compatible server
// on localhost instead of Apple FM, so a candidate open-weights model can be
// scored on the shipping fixtures. `--engine apple-fm` is the default and the
// baseline. See `LocalHTTPPolishEngine.swift` for what that measurement is and is
// not worth.

    --lang (#439) reroutes every fixture in the file — `--lang auto` runs a
    per-language set through the Auto-detect prompt, `--lang fr` pins an auto set
    to the French one. The path is a device SETTING, not a property of the text.

    --mode (#393) arms a Smart Mode by catalogue identifier, so its prompt, its
    user-turn framing and its OWN acceptance contract are what run. On `ab`,
    --mode-a / --mode-b arm one side each; a side with no mode is the free polish,
    so `ab --mode-b notes` is the mode against free polish.

    guardrail (#413, #414, #466) scores the three output-inspection checks against
    committed, hand-labelled outputs. It drives NO model and needs no Apple
    Intelligence, so the measurement behind their thresholds is re-runnable by
    anyone. Corpora live in docs/research/413-414-guardrail/.

    target (#456) scores the polish TARGET election — which language the model is
    told to write in — against committed, hand-labelled raw transcripts, and
    --sweep sweeps the dominance floor it turns on. Also drives no model. Corpus
    in docs/research/456-target-election/.
