    /// ### Why the catalogue's `displayName` is not simply used
    ///
    /// DictusCore ships no string catalog. That is why every user-facing sentence it
    /// owns — `SmartModeUnavailableReason.englishDescription`, `ProFeature.displayName`
    /// — is English and documented as the log form and the fallback, with the surface
    /// owning the translation keyed on the case. `KeyboardSmartModeState.localizedReason`
    /// is that pattern; this is the same pattern for the one mode whose name is a
    /// word rather than a symbol.
    ///
    /// Most modes need nothing here. `"\u{2192} EN"` is deliberately language-neutral
    /// so one string fits a 46 pt fan row in every UI locale, and it falls straight
    /// through. Two modes have a name that has to be said in the
    /// user's language: the bullet mode, renamed from `Notes` to `List` / `Liste` on
    /// 2026-08-27, and `Structured` / `Structuré` (#523).
    ///
    /// Keyed on the **identifier**, which the rename deliberately did not touch: no
    /// persisted armed mode is invalidated and no pinned order is lost. A record that
    /// crossed the App Group from an older build carries the old `displayName` and
    /// still lands on the right string here, because the identifier is what is
    /// matched.
    ///
    /// This file has a twin in DictusApp, and it has to: the two targets have
    /// separate string catalogs, and a shared one would mean a catalog in DictusCore.

    ///
    /// `SmartModeFailure` and `SmartModeSkipNotice` both travel across the App Group
    /// carrying exactly that pair, and both name a mode in a sentence. `fallback` is
    /// the name the *writing* build used, which is what an unrecognised identifier
