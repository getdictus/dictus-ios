/// `startRecording()`. `KeyboardWaveformDriver.shared` is the existing precedent for
/// a second observed object beside `KeyboardState` in `KeyboardRootView`.

    /// menu with one item, no way to learn what the others are, and nothing to
    /// undo. The user is told where the list lives instead. Only reachable by
    /// unpinning everything in the app — a fresh install seeds two
    /// (`SmartModeCatalogue.defaultPinnedIdentifiers`).
    ///
    /// Both halves of that condition matter, and #402 is the bill for checking only
    /// the first: with a mode armed, the Normal row is the one surface that clears
    /// it, so the fan opens on it alone. `SmartModeFanLayout.entries` owns the rule
    /// and states it at length; an empty result is the refusal.
    ///
    /// **Nothing is on sale.** With `PremiumFlags.paywallVisible` down and no
    /// subscription, the whole surface is absent rather than locked — the rule
    /// `HistoryAvailability` already applies to the transcription history (#460).
    /// Nobody loses a feature: no subscription can be bought while the flag is down,
    /// so nobody is entitled, so nothing is being taken from someone who paid. This
    /// refusal is silent — not even the "pick your modes" line below, which would
    /// point at a screen the app does not offer either.
    ///
    /// All three refusals return **before** `presentAreaMode`, which is what keeps
    /// them out of the keyboard's declared height constraint (#166): the area mode
    /// never becomes `.smartModeFan`, so no layout pass is asked for.
