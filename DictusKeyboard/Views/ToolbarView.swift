/// The bar has two presentations (#241) and keeps its 52 pt in both, so opening

///     closed:  [☰]  ← centre slot →  [🎤 pill]
///     open:    [✕]                   [Dictus Pro] [⚙]
///
/// There is deliberately no mic while the panel is open: the panel is not a
/// surface anyone dictates from, and the mic's absence is what makes the state

    /// after that it is furniture. The drift is what buys the second look.
