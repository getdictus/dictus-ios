/// The tail of a keyboard dictation, in the process that runs it (#361).
///
/// DictusApp transcribes and writes the raw text; from `transcriptionReady` onwards
/// everything happens here: polish, the trailing separator, and the insertion.
///
/// ### Why the call moved
///
/// Apple refuses `LanguageModelSession` generations to backgrounded processes, and
/// DictusApp is backgrounded for every keyboard dictation by design — measured at
/// ~10% failure over a spread-out day and 45% during a dense working session,
/// latching for twelve minutes at a time (#315). The keyboard extension is in the
/// foreground at exactly the moment polish runs: the user has stopped speaking and
/// is waiting for text. Twenty consecutive generations from here, fired while the
/// app was visibly being refused, all succeeded with no degradation (#361,
/// 2026-08-23). Moving the call does not work around the limit; it stops meeting it.
///
/// ### The two rules this type exists to hold
///
/// **The raw is durable before any generation starts.** `PendingDictation` is written
/// the moment the raw is claimed, so the worst case stays what it already was — the
/// dictation degrades to raw insertion — rather than becoming a new class of loss.
///
/// **A generation may only be typed into the field it came from.** The extension is
/// not torn down mid-generation, it is suspended, and one measured generation resumed
/// forty-four minutes later. `documentIdentifier` is what stops that landing in
/// somebody else's document.
