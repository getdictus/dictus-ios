/// When recording, the keyboard letters must be completely replaced by the recording UI
/// to prevent accidental key presses. SwiftUI's conditional rendering (`if/else`) fully
/// removes the inactive view from the hierarchy, freeing its memory and preventing
/// ghost touches. An overlay or ZStack would keep both views alive.
