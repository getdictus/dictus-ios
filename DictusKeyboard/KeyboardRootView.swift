/// Phase 18 architecture change: The keyboard grid is now a UIKit GiellaKeyboardView
/// added as a direct subview in KeyboardViewController. This SwiftUI view only renders:
/// - ToolbarView (always visible when not recording)
/// - RecordingOverlay (replaces keyboard area during recording)
/// - EmojiPickerView (replaces the key grid, toolbar stays)
///
/// Which of those it renders is decided by a single `KeyboardAreaMode` read from
/// KeyboardState (#271) — the same value KeyboardViewController switches on for
/// the layout, so the two layers cannot drift apart.
///
/// WHY SwiftUI for toolbar/overlay but UIKit for keys:
/// The toolbar and recording overlay are simple SwiftUI layouts that don't need
/// zero-latency touch handling. The key grid needs UICollectionView's proven touch
/// pipeline for zero dead zones. Mixing UIKit keys + SwiftUI chrome gives us both.
