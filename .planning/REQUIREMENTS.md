## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud transcription | Contradicts privacy/offline identity |
| Subscription / monetization | Contradicts open-source positioning |
| Android port | Different platform entirely, v3+ |
| Apple Watch companion | Too niche for roadmap |
| iOS Shortcuts integration | Nice-to-have, not core |
| QWERTZ layout | Insufficient demand for v1, easy to add later |
