# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** A user can dictate text in French in any iOS app and correct it immediately on the same keyboard — no subscription, no cloud, no account.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — Infrastructure & App Polish

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 10 (Infrastructure & App Polish)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-07 — Phase 6 Plan 1 complete (design consolidation + app icon)

Progress: [██████████▓░░░░░░░░░] 53% (5/10 phases, 1/3 plans in phase 6)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18 (v1.0)
- Average duration: ~25 min
- Total execution time: ~7.5 hours (v1.0)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 4 | ~100 min | ~25 min |
| 2. Transcription | 3 | ~75 min | ~25 min |
| 3. Dictation UX | 4 | ~100 min | ~25 min |
| 4. App & Polish | 5 | ~125 min | ~25 min |
| 5. Settings | 2 | ~50 min | ~25 min |
| 6. Infra & Polish | 1/3 | ~9 min | ~9 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.0: 18 plans in 4 days
- v1.1: Plan 1 completed in 9 min (faster due to no TDD overhead)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [06-01]: Design files consolidated into DictusCore with public access -- INFRA-01 resolved
- [06-01]: public extension pattern for cross-module design tokens (Color.dictusAccent etc.)
- [06-01]: CoreGraphics script for reproducible app icon generation
- [v1.0]: FillerWordFilter removed -- Whisper handles fillers natively
- [v1.0]: SmartModelRouter bypassed -- runtime model switching breaks background recording

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MOD-02 (Parakeet v3) is highest-risk requirement — FluidAudio SDK maturity and French accuracy unproven. May need to defer to v1.2 during Phase 10 planning.
- COLD-03 (auto-return) has no known public API — research spike needed. Competitors' technique is undocumented.
- PRED memory budget — text prediction must stay under 5MB resident in keyboard extension. Needs real-device profiling.
