**Core value:** A user can dictate text in French in any iOS app and correct it immediately on the same keyboard — no subscription, no cloud, no account.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — Infrastructure & App Polish

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 10 (Infrastructure & App Polish)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-07 — v1.1 roadmap created

Progress: [██████████░░░░░░░░░░] 50% (5/10 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18 (v1.0)
- Average duration: ~25 min
- Total execution time: ~7.5 hours (v1.0)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 4 | ~100 min | ~25 min |
| 2. Transcription | 3 | ~75 min | ~25 min |
| 3. Dictation UX | 4 | ~100 min | ~25 min |
| 4. App & Polish | 5 | ~125 min | ~25 min |
| 5. Settings | 2 | ~50 min | ~25 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.0: 18 plans in 4 days
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.0]: Design file duplication between DictusApp and DictusKeyboard needs revisiting — now INFRA-01
- [v1.0]: FillerWordFilter removed — Whisper handles fillers natively
- [v1.0]: SmartModelRouter bypassed — runtime model switching breaks background recording

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MOD-02 (Parakeet v3) is highest-risk requirement — FluidAudio SDK maturity and French accuracy unproven. May need to defer to v1.2 during Phase 10 planning.
- COLD-03 (auto-return) has no known public API — research spike needed. Competitors' technique is undocumented.
- PRED memory budget — text prediction must stay under 5MB resident in keyboard extension. Needs real-device profiling.
