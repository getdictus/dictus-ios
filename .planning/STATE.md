# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** A user can dictate text in French in any iOS app and correct it immediately on the same keyboard -- no subscription, no cloud, no account.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 complete, Phase 13 next (Cold Start Audio Bridge)

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 16 (Animation State Fixes) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (all done)
Status: Phase 12 complete, ready for Phase 13
Last activity: 2026-03-12 -- Plan 12-02 executed (watchdog recovery, device verification approved)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- v1.0: 18 plans in 4 days (~25 min avg)
- v1.1: 29 plans in 5 days (~4 min avg)
- v1.2: 4 plans (~8 min avg)
- Total: 50 plans across 2 milestones

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- Phase 11-02: Level color/icon defined in DebugLogView (UI concern) not LogLevel enum (keeps DictusCore framework-agnostic)
- [Phase 12]: Replace asyncAfter with withAnimation for success flash to eliminate timer race condition
- [Phase 12]: Reset all animation @State properties before new animations to prevent stacking
- [Phase 12-02]: Do NOT instant-reset on keyboardAppear -- URL scheme causes rapid disappear/appear within ~2s, killing legitimate recordings. Use refreshFromDefaults + 5s watchdog instead.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Cold start auto-return has no public API -- Audio Bridge + UX messaging is the pragmatic path (Phase 13)
- CoreML compilation timing is device-specific -- need real-device calibration on 4GB/6GB/8GB tiers (Phase 14)
- Developer account not yet purchased -- blocks Phase 16 (TestFlight)
- App Group ID stability across team migration must be verified before shipping v1.2 code
