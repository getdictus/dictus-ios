# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** A user can dictate text in French in any iOS app and correct it immediately on the same keyboard -- no subscription, no cloud, no account.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.7 — Stability, Polish & i18n (roadmap defined, ready for Phase 34 planning)

## Current Position

Phase: 34 (Silent Insertion Fix) — not yet planned
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap defined, awaiting phase planning
Last activity: 2026-04-15 — v1.7 roadmap defined

Progress: ░░░░░░░░░░ 0% (0/6 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- v1.0: 18 plans in 4 days
- v1.1: 29 plans in 5 days
- v1.2: 35 plans in 17 days
- v1.3: 14 plans in 11 days
- v1.4: 15 plans in 7 days
- Total: 111 plans across 5 milestones in 35 days

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All prior decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.7 roadmap decisions:**
- Phase numbering starts at 34 to avoid collision with v1.5 Dictus Pro premium worktree (phases 30-33).
- STAB-01 isolated in Phase 34 so the silent insertion bug can ship as a hotfix independent of heavier keyboard/autocorrect/i18n work.
- KBD-01 + KBD-02 bundled in Phase 35 because both target keyboard geometry and the audit (KBD-01) drives the glitch fix (KBD-02).
- AUTO-01 + AUTO-02 + AUTO-03 bundled in Phase 36 — AOSP LatinIME alignment is a single coherent architectural change, splitting would cause rework.
- I18N-01 (Phase 38) scheduled before I18N-02 (Phase 39) — German is the first validation of the i18n process, not an independent feature.

### Pending Todos

- Adaptive accent key shows apostrophe after "qu" (UI todo from v1.4)

### Known Issues Carried to v1.7

None — BUG-71 fixed via PR #81, BUG-72 fixed via PR #86.

### Parallel Milestone

- **v1.5 Dictus Pro** in progress on `feature/premium` worktree (Phase 30/33 — 25% done)
- Sync via `sync/develop-to-premium` branch
- v1.7 uses phases 34-39 to avoid collision with premium phases 30-33

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
