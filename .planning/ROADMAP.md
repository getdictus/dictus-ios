## Phase Details

### Phase 11: Logging Foundation
**Goal**: Developers and beta testers can diagnose issues with structured, privacy-safe logs exportable from the app
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.2)
**Requirements**: LOG-01, LOG-02, LOG-03, LOG-04, LOG-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. App and keyboard extension write structured log entries with level (debug/info/warning/error) and subsystem tags visible in exported output
  2. Exported logs contain zero transcription text, keystrokes, or audio content regardless of log level
  3. User can tap a button in Settings to share a log file that includes device header (iOS version, app version, active model)
  4. Log file never exceeds 500 lines -- oldest entries are discarded when limit is reached
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01-PLAN.md — Structured logging API (LogEvent types, PersistentLog evolution, unit tests)
- [ ] 11-02-PLAN.md — Subsystem instrumentation, DebugLogView upgrade, export in Settings

### Phase 12: Animation State Fixes
**Goal**: Recording overlay and waveform animations behave reliably across all dictation state transitions
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (logging needed to diagnose intermittent issues on device)
**Requirements**: ANIM-01, ANIM-02, ANIM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Recording overlay appears every time user taps mic and dictation starts -- zero intermittent disappearances across 20 consecutive tests
  2. Rapid mic tap sequences (start/stop/start within 1 second) never leave the overlay or waveform in a stale state
  3. Waveform animation stops cleanly when transcription completes and mic button returns to ready state
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Overlay visibility fix, .requested state, animation race fixes, diagnostic log events
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — Watchdog recovery mechanisms (keyboard + app), reset-on-appear, device verification

### Phase 13: Cold Start Audio Bridge
**Goal**: Users experience seamless dictation even when the app was killed by iOS, with minimal manual intervention to return to the keyboard
**Depends on**: Phase 12 (stable animation required before adding new recording paths)
**Requirements**: COLD-01, COLD-02, COLD-03, COLD-04, COLD-05, COLD-06, COLD-07, COLD-08, COLD-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On cold start, keyboard captures audio directly after the app activates the audio session, and transcription result appears in the text field
  2. App shows a minimal "swipe back" overlay on cold start instead of full app UI
  3. Recording begins when user returns to the keyboard, not when the app opens
  4. For apps with known URL schemes, user is auto-returned to the previous app after audio session activation
  5. Direct recording from the app (non-keyboard flow) still works identically to v1.1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md — Cold start infrastructure: SharedKeys, KnownAppSchemes, launch mode detection, conditional MainTabView
- [ ] 13-02-PLAN.md — SwipeBackOverlayView with animated swipe gesture, brand gradient, bilingual text
- [ ] 13-03-PLAN.md — Auto-return via URL scheme, keyboard source detection, Info.plist schemes, device verification

### Phase 14: Model Pipeline
**Goal**: Model download, CoreML compilation, and engine selection work reliably with clear progress feedback and no crashes on constrained devices
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (logging for compilation diagnostics)
**Requirements**: MODEL-01, MODEL-02, MODEL-03, MODEL-04, MODEL-05, MODEL-06, MODEL-07, MODEL-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Large Turbo v3 is hidden or gated on devices with 4GB RAM or less -- user cannot trigger a compilation crash
  2. After downloading a model, CoreML compilation starts automatically with a visible progress indicator, and user cannot accidentally navigate away
  3. If model prewarming fails, user sees a retry option that cleans up and re-attempts instead of a permanent error
  4. Mic button in keyboard is disabled with a message while a model is compiling in the main app
  5. Selecting a Parakeet model actually invokes Parakeet for transcription, and the model displays as "Parakeet v3" (not "Whisper Parakeet v3")
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Remove Large Turbo, RAM-based recommendation, compilation progress fix, retry-with-cleanup
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Dynamic onboarding model selection, Parakeet routing and display name verification
- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — Gap closure: fix stale ModelInfoTests after Large Turbo v3 removal
- [ ] 14-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: fix prewarm progress bar stuck at zero (state transition ordering)

### Phase 15: Design Polish
**Goal**: All user-facing UI reaches beta quality with correct French localization and polished interaction details
**Depends on**: Phase 14 (model manager changes must land before cosmetic polish)
**Requirements**: DSGN-01, DSGN-02, DSGN-03, DSGN-04, DSGN-05, DSGN-06, DSGN-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All French UI strings display correct accents (modele with accent, dictee with accent, reglages with accent, telecharges with accent, etc.)
  2. Active model in model manager has a visible blue border highlight, and tapping anywhere on a downloaded model card selects it
  3. Recording overlay X button has a generous tap area (44pt minimum) with haptic feedback and smooth easeOut dismiss animation
  4. Mic button shows reduced opacity during transcription processing, giving clear visual feedback that work is happening
**Plans**: 10 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 15-01-PLAN.md — French accent audit, gauge colors, mic button opacity, settings UX
- [ ] 15-02-PLAN.md — Model card redesign (tap-to-select, swipe-to-delete, active highlight)
- [ ] 15-03-PLAN.md — Recording overlay polish (hit area, haptics, dismiss animation, waveform logging)
- [ ] 15-04-PLAN.md — Onboarding success screen, bug fixes (#25 model sync, #26 crash)
- [ ] 15-05-PLAN.md — Gap closure: fix last unaccented French string (MicPermissionPage)
- [ ] 15-06-PLAN.md — Gap closure: model card UX overhaul (progress bar, active border, tap area, section move)
- [ ] 15-07-PLAN.md — Gap closure: overlay fade-out fix, onboarding auto-transition to success
- [ ] 15-08-PLAN.md — Gap closure: keyboard detection crash resilience and diagnostic logging
- [ ] 15-09-PLAN.md — UAT gap closure: active card blue tint + remove switch spinner + swipe delete height
- [ ] 15-10-PLAN.md — UAT gap closure: waveform vertical stability + settings tap feedback

### Phase 15.3: Keyboard optimization and responsiveness (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Reduce keyboard input latency to match native iOS keyboard feel and adjust key spacing/dimensions to match Apple keyboard proportions
**Requirements**: #44, #29
**Depends on:** Phase 15.2
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Letter keys use UIKit UIViewRepresentable (not SwiftUI DragGesture) for touch handling
  2. Audio and haptic fire on touchDown (not touchUp), matching Apple keyboard behavior
  3. Suggestion computation runs on background queue with coalescing (not main thread)
  4. Key dimensions are device-adaptive across 3 device classes (compact, standard, large)
  5. Side margins approximately equal inter-key gap (not 3pt margins with 4pt/6pt gaps)
  6. Delete, space, and return keys show background color change on press
  7. OSSignposter instrumentation ready for Instruments profiling on physical device
**Plans:** 3/4 plans executed

Plans:
- [ ] 15.3-01-PLAN.md — Quick wins: haptic cache, KeyMetrics static let, pipeline reorder, suggestion background queue, OSSignposter
- [ ] 15.3-02-PLAN.md — UIViewRepresentable touch handler for letter keys (replace DragGesture)
- [ ] 15.3-03-PLAN.md — Device-adaptive key dimensions and press feedback colors
- [ ] 15.3-04-PLAN.md — Visual and functional verification on simulator

### Phase 15.2: Cleaning and Fix GitHub Issues (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Fix ship-blocking bugs (waveform rendering in keyboard extension, Dynamic Island desync after chaining, stale transcription cards) and triage GitHub issues before TestFlight beta
**Requirements**: #37, #42, #41
**Depends on:** Phase 15.1
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Waveform bars animate visibly during recording in keyboard extension after both cold and warm starts
  2. Dynamic Island stays in sync with dictation state across 5+ chained recordings
  3. Previous transcription card is always cleared when starting a new recording from any entry path
  4. All resolved/duplicate GitHub issues are closed with references; deferred issues remain open
**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 15.2-01-PLAN.md — Waveform rendering fix (#37 residual) + entry path state clearing (#41)
- [x] 15.2-02-PLAN.md — LiveActivityManager state machine refactor (#42)
- [x] 15.2-03-PLAN.md — GitHub issue triage (close resolved, consolidate duplicates)
- [ ] 15.2-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: waveform/overlay off-screen recovery (#45)

### Phase 15.1: UI polish fixes (#30, #33, #34, #24) (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Fix button alignment (#30), app display name and logo centering (#33), swipe-back overlay improvements (#34), and recording sound feedback with settings (#24) before TestFlight beta
