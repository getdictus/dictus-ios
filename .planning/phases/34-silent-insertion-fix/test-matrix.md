# Phase 34 — Manual Verification Test Matrix

> Artifact that formally closes STAB-01. Referenced from the fix PR description
> and from issue #118 when we mark it resolved.
>
> **Evidence discipline:** every PASS/FAIL entry cites a `keyboardInsertProbe`
> / `keyboardInsertRetry` / `keyboardInsertFailed` log line. No raw
> transcription text is ever pasted — logs contain counts/booleans/timings only
> (enforced in Plan 01, verified in LogPrivacyTests).
>
> **Device:** real iPhone running the build that ships plans 01 + 02 + 03.
> Simulator does NOT count — `textDocumentProxy` behaves differently and the
> bug is real-device-only per issue #118.

## 50-Run Protocol

**Goal:** 50 consecutive real-device dictations with zero silent drops
(STAB-01 success criterion #1).

**Target apps (rotate across the 50 runs):**
- Notes — long existing document (non-empty field)
- Notes — new empty note (empty field edge case)
- Messages — chat input (multi-line, autocorrect active)
- Safari — address bar (short field, autocomplete active)

**Scenario distribution across the 50 runs:**
- Runs 01-30: **warm path** — keyboard already up, dictate, wait for insert
- Runs 31-40: **cold start** — force-kill DictusApp via app switcher before each run
- Runs 41-50: **rapid chained** — 2-3 dictations back-to-back in same app

**Per-run procedure:**
1. Note the `sessionID` (emitted in probe log).
2. Dictate a phrase (≥ 5 words so `transcriptionCount` is non-trivial).
3. Wait for insertion OR failure banner.
4. Export logs via the existing log-dump UX.
5. Record: `PASS` if text landed AND exactly one `keyboardInsertProbe` with
   zero `keyboardInsertRetry`/`keyboardInsertFailed` for that sessionID.
   `FAIL` otherwise.
6. Privacy check (spot-check every 10 runs): grep the exported log for a
   distinctive dictated word. Expected: ZERO hits.

**Pass bar:** 50/50 PASS. Any FAIL is a blocker — diagnose, fix, rerun
the entire 50-run protocol. Partial success does not close STAB-01.

## #118 Repro Matrix

**Goal:** every scenario originally reported in issue #118 now produces a
visible outcome (success OR loud-fail UX) — no silent drops (STAB-01 success
criterion #2).

| # | Scenario | Steps | Expected | Result | Log Evidence |
|---|----------|-------|----------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Warm same-app dictation | Keyboard already up in Notes, dictate short phrase | Text lands, 1× probe `path=warmDarwin attempt=0` | ⬜ pending | — |
| 2 | Cold start | Force-kill DictusApp, open Messages, tap mic, dictate | Text lands, 1× probe `path=coldStartBridge attempt=0` | ⬜ pending | — |
| 3 | Backgrounded keyboard | Switch app while dictation in flight, return | Either text lands OR banner+DI failure + home card updated | ⬜ pending | — |
| 4 | Rapid chained recordings | Three back-to-back dictations in Notes | 3× text landed, 3× probe entries with distinct sessionIDs | ⬜ pending | — |

## 3-Path Regression Checklist

**Goal:** confirm each of the three insertion code paths is exercised by the
new helper and observed in logs (STAB-01 success criterion #3).

| Path | How exercised | Expected log signature | Result | Notes |
|------|---------------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| warm Darwin | Keyboard up when Darwin notification arrives | `keyboardInsertProbe path=warmDarwin` | ⬜ pending | — |
| cold start Audio Bridge | DictusApp killed, keyboard bridges via URL scheme, Darwin arrives post-wake | `keyboardInsertProbe path=coldStartBridge` | ⬜ pending | — |
| chained recording | Second dictation starts before first state fully resets | `keyboardInsertProbe` with two distinct `sessionID` values in quick succession | ⬜ pending | — |
