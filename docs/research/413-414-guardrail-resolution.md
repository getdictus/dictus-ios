## 0. Why the two ship together

They edit the same file and they ask it the same question: **look inside the output at a finer
resolution than the whole blob.** #413 segments it for language; #414 compares it to the input for
content. Doing one without the other means opening `PolishGuardrail.swift` twice with the same
question.

## 1. What is broken, in one line each

**#413.** `PolishGuardrail.detectedLanguageMatches` runs `NLLanguageRecognizer` over the whole
output. That answers *"what is the dominant language of this text"*, and a list that drifts item by
item keeps its aggregate reading. Measured in round 1: an output of 5 English bullets + 1 French
read as **French at 0.789** and was **accepted**; a wholly-English one on the same fixture read as
**English at 0.607** and was correctly rejected. The more broken output is the one that got
through.

**#414.** `SmartModeNotesPrompt` carries a worked example whose output contains
`- Appeler Sophie avant : elle a les données de décembre`. That exact line appeared in an
**accepted** output on a dictation that names neither Sophie nor December. Neither guardrail can
see it: a fabricated bullet is the same length as a real one, and it is in the target language.

## 2. Who consumes `PolishGuardrail`, and what a wrong answer costs them

`PolishGuardrail` has exactly one caller: `PolishPipeline.transform`, at two sites (the length
band, then `languageGuardrailPasses`). `transform` in turn is reached by:

| Consumer | Path | Cost of a WRONG REJECTION | Cost of a WRONG ACCEPTANCE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free polish, in DictusApp (`PolishService.polishTargeted` / `polishAutoDetected` ← `PolishCoordinator`) | every dictation with polish on | **Low.** `resolvedOutput` returns the deterministic floor — the user's own words with verbal punctuation applied, merely unpolished | Low. ADR 0003 output is close to the input by construction |
| Free polish, in the keyboard extension (since #361) | every dictation | same as above | same as above |
| A Smart Mode | every armed dictation | **High.** `resolvedOutput` returns `nil` and **nothing is inserted**. The user speaks, waits, and gets a red message | **High.** Invented content, or the wrong language, lands in a document they are about to send |
| `polish-harness` | measurement only | none | none |

**The asymmetry is the whole design constraint, and it runs the opposite way to intuition.** A new
check is *cheapest* to get wrong on free polish — which is where it runs on every user — and
*most expensive* on the Smart Mode that needs it. So a check that cannot be made false-positive-free
on the mode corpus must not ship on the mode, whatever it buys.

## 3. What each new check does when it is uncertain

#79's fail-closed guarantee cuts both ways: a wrong rejection loses the user's words, a wrong
acceptance puts invented content in their document. Every uncertainty branch is therefore written
down here, before the code exists.

**#413, the per-segment language check.**
- Segment too short to read → **pass**. Same philosophy as today's 12-character floor: acting on
  an unreliable detection is worse than not acting.
- Segment read with low confidence → **pass**. 0.789 was a *confident wrong* answer, so a floor
  alone never was the fix (#413 says so); the floor exists only to stop the check firing on noise.
- Recogniser returns nothing → **pass**.
- Only a **confident disagreement** rejects. Uncertainty is always resolved toward accepting.

**#414, the grounding check.**
- The output's language is not the input's (translation, repair) → **the check does not run at
  all.** A translation localises names, months and weekdays by design, so surface identity is not
  expected and the check would be measuring the wrong thing.
- No anchor found in the output → **pass** (vacuously). This is a real limit and §6 states it: a
  refusal carrying no name and no figure is invisible to this check, which is why #349 needs the
  *second* query over the same primitive rather than this one.
- An anchor found but the input cannot be normalised for comparison → **pass**.
- Only an anchor that is **present in the output and absent from the input** rejects.

## 4. The bars, pre-registered

Fixed before scoring. The mechanism and its parameters are what the measurement chooses; **these
are not negotiable by the result.** If a mechanism cannot clear them, it is reported as failing,
not relaxed.

### The corpus

Every output committed by the #393 campaign, extracted from
`docs/research/79-smart-modes/raw/` and committed here as `413-414-guardrail/corpus.json`:
**110 outputs** — 30 from round 1 (Notes), 30 from round 2 (Translate → EN), 29 from round 7
(Notes v2), 10 from round 3 and 11 from round 4 (the free-polish/mode A/B passes). Accepted and
rejected engine outputs alike, since a check has to keep the rejections rejected.

Round 4 contributes 11 of its 12 recoverable outputs: the free-polish side of `T3` is excluded
because Italian on the French per-language path is skipped by the gibberish gate, so **the
guardrail never ran on it** and scoring it would score a code path that does not exist.

Each output is hand-labelled `sameLanguage` / `bilingual` / `wrongLanguage` and `grounded` /
`fabricated`, by reading, with the label written into the committed file so anyone can disagree
with it in the open. (The count in the first draft of this paragraph was 111 with a per-round
breakdown that was written before the corpus existed and never corrected; found in review.)

Plus an adversarial set written by hand for the cases the campaign does not contain — a French
list quoting English product names, a German list (where every noun is capitalised), a one-bullet
output, an output of pure proper nouns.

### #413

| | Bar | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **G1** | The N3 run-3 output (5 English bullets + 1 French) is **rejected** | absolute |
| **G2** | Every output already rejected by the shipping check stays rejected | absolute |
| **G3** | Every output hand-labelled `sameLanguage` is **accepted** | **0 false rejections**, absolute |
| **G4** | The adversarial French-list-quoting-English set is accepted | **0 false rejections**, absolute |
| **G5** | Free polish, single-passage output: behaviour byte-identical to today | pinned by a unit test |

### #414

| | Bar | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **F1** | The N2 run-5 output (`Sophie` / `décembre`) is **rejected** | absolute |
| **F2** | Every output hand-labelled `grounded` is **accepted** | **0 false rejections**, absolute |
| **F3** | The check does not run where it is unsound, and the code says why | by reading |
| **F4** | Recall is **reported, not gated**: how many hand-built fabrications it misses | reported |

F4 is deliberately not a gate. A precision-first check that catches the measured case and never
rejects a good output is worth shipping even at poor recall; a recall-first one that costs a user
their dictation is not. Stating this before the numbers exist is the point.

### Both

| | Bar | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** | The rejection rate on `polish-harness`'s shipping fixtures does not rise, except on the outputs the checks are built to catch | absolute |
| **H2** | `cd DictusCore && swift test` green, `swiftlint lint --strict` clean | absolute |

## 5. The mechanisms, and the ordered changes

Written before the measurement; §6 reports whether they held.

1. **`PolishGuardrail` gains a segment-aware language check.** Split the output on line breaks
   (after `decodeNewlines`, one bullet is one line), run the recogniser per segment, reject on a
   confident disagreement. The whole-blob check stays, because it is what catches a wholly-wrong
   single passage. Two parameters — minimum segment length, and the confidence floor at which a
   disagreement counts — are chosen by scoring the corpus, not guessed.
2. **`PolishGuardrail` gains a grounding check**, built on `NLTagger`'s `.nameType` scheme rather
   than on a capitalised-token heuristic. The heuristic is not merely worse, it is unusable: German
   capitalises every noun, so it would flag `Rechnung`, `Büro` and `Freitag` in an ordinary German
   sentence. `NLTagger` reads the same sentence and returns only `Herr Müller`.
3. **`PolishAcceptanceContract` gains a field** saying whether its outputs are subject to the
   grounding check — a field rather than a derivation, for the reason `SmartModeOverflowBehaviour`
   is one: a custom mode (#269) must answer the question rather than inherit an answer from a
   property chosen for something else. It decodes with a **default of off**, because the record
   crosses the App Group inside the per-dictation snapshot and an app update can land between the
   write and the read; off means one dictation across one upgrade behaves as it does today, where
   on could cost that dictation its text.
4. **`PolishPipeline` dispatches the new check** off that field, next to the language dispatch it
   already does.
5. **Tests.** `PolishGuardrail` is pure logic; every case above gets one, with the measured
   strings from the campaign rather than invented ones.
6. **A harness command** that scores the committed corpus offline, so the measurement is
   re-runnable by anyone — it drives no model and needs no Apple Intelligence.

### Risks

- **The grounding check's false-positive rate is the shipping risk.** It is the only new way for a
  user to lose a dictation. F2 is absolute for that reason.
- **`NLTagger` recall is context-sensitive.** The probe already shows `Thomas` recognised on its
  own line and missed inside the same six-line block. Running the tagger per segment as well as
  whole is the mitigation; what it still misses goes in §6.
- **Digits as an anchor are likely unusable and will be measured anyway.** ADR 0003 rule 3
  authorises free polish to turn spoken numbers into digits, and round 3 shows it doing exactly
  that (`eighteen` → `18`, `8000` → `8 000`). A digit anchor would reject those. Measured, then
  reported, then almost certainly dropped.
- **German is unmeasured by the campaign.** No German fixture exists. `NLTagger` is the choice
  that makes German *safe by construction* rather than by measurement, and that gap is stated
  rather than papered over.
- **A prompt example that carries no name and no figure stays invisible.** This closes the
  measured hole, not the class.

## 6. Results

**160 Apple Foundation Models calls** on this Mac (macOS 26.5.1), plus **128 hand-labelled
outputs replayed offline** through the two checks. Every raw output is committed under
`413-414-guardrail/raw/`. The offline replay is the load-bearing measurement and it drives no
model, so anyone can re-run it:

```sh
cd DictusCore
swift run polish-harness guardrail ../docs/research/413-414-guardrail/corpus.json \
                                   ../docs/research/413-414-guardrail/adversarial.json --sweep
```

### 6.1 #413 — every bar cleared

| Bar | Threshold | Measured | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** the 5-English-plus-1-French output is rejected | absolute | rejected | ✓ |
| **G2** outputs already rejected stay rejected | absolute | 10/10 | ✓ |
| **G3** every `sameLanguage` output accepted | 0 false rejections | **0 / 117** | ✓ |
| **G4** the French-list-quoting-English set accepted | 0 false rejections | **0 / 9** | ✓ |
| **G5** free polish single passage unchanged | pinned by a test | pinned | ✓ |

**The two thresholds sit in an empty band 0.42 wide.** Over 273 segments:

| | worst case |
|---|---|
| A **legitimate** segment read as the wrong language | `Checker le build sur GitHub Actions` — **en 0.504** |
| A genuinely **drifted** segment, weakest reading | `Total 3 major changes` — **en 0.927** |

Only 3 of 219 legitimate segments disagreed with their expected language at all, and the other two
were at 0.220 and 0.164. The sweep gives `11 caught / 0 false rejections` for **every** pair from
(12 chars, 0.60) to (40 chars, 0.95), so the choice of (12, 0.85) is not balanced on a knife edge.
The floor sits near the top of the band rather than its middle, deliberately: too high leaves
today's behaviour, too low costs a Smart Mode user everything they said.

**What #413 predicted and the measurement confirmed.** Raising the confidence floor alone was
never the fix. The accepted bilingual output reads as French at **0.789** as one blob — a
*confident wrong* answer — so no floor low enough to be useful rejects it. Read line by line the
same text is `fr 1.000`, then `en 0.992 / 0.988 / 0.908 / 0.961 / 0.999`.

**Sentence-level segmentation was measured and is not what ships.** It buys nothing on this corpus
and spends the confidence floor on segments too short to read.

### 6.2 #414 — the check ships, and its first acceptance criterion is NOT met

| Bar | Threshold | Measured | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** the `Sophie` / `décembre` output is rejected | absolute | rejected | ✓ |
| **F2** every `grounded` output accepted | 0 false rejections | **0 / 83** | ✓ |
| **F3** the check is off where it is unsound, and the code says why | by reading | Translate and Repair, with the reason on each | ✓ |
| **F4** recall, reported not gated | reported | **7 / 9** | — |

Two of the nine were added in review and are described in §6.5. The two **misses** are the whole
story of this issue, and one of them was not predicted.

**Miss 1, declared in advance.** #349's refusal — *"Je suis désolé, mais je ne peux pas fournir une
sortie polie…"* — carries no person, place or organisation, so a check built on grounded anchors
has nothing to look at. Named in §4 before the run as expected to be missed.

**Miss 2, found LIVE during this verification, and it changes the verdict.** The 30-call Notes run
made to check this change **reproduced the Sophie fabrication**, with one clause reworded, and the
shipped check **accepted it**:

```
committed (round 1)   - Appeler Sophie avant : elle a les données de décembre        → NLTagger tags Sophie
live      (this run)  - Appeler Sophie avant parce qu'elle a les données de décembre → NLTagger tags NOTHING
```

Same name, same position in the bullet, same language. A different continuation. No framing
recovers it: the tagger was run over the whole output, over each line with its list marker, and
over each line without, and none of the three finds it.

So: **#414's acceptance criterion 1 — "No prompt example can appear in output without appearing in
the input" — is not met, and this run has a live counterexample rather than a theoretical one.**
The case is committed as `Z1-sophie-reoccurrence` and pinned by a test that asserts the miss on
purpose, so the next attempt is scored against it from the first line of code.

**Why `NLTagger` and not capitalised words.** German capitalises every noun. On
`Die Rechnung für das Büro muss bis Freitag bezahlt werden` a capitalised-token heuristic proposes
`Rechnung`, `Büro` and `Freitag` and refuses an ordinary German note; the tagger returns
`Herr Müller` and nothing else. The #393 campaign measured no German at all, so the primitive had
to be safe there by construction rather than by measurement.

**Figures were measured as a second anchor kind and dropped.** ADR 0003 rule 3 authorises the
polish to turn spoken numbers into digits, and round 3 shows it doing exactly that —
`the build image is on eighteen` came back as `on 18`, and `8000` as `8 000`. A figure anchor
rejects a correct transformation. Same for a translation: `alle undici` becomes `at 11`. This is
the half of the maintainer's hypothesis that does not survive contact with the corpus.

**A capitalised-token rule WAS measured as an addition, and does not ship.** It closes the live
miss — one more catch — at the cost of **2 false rejections in 82**, both flagging
`February` / `March` on French dictations. Two things are true about them and neither rescues the
rule: those two outputs are rejected by the language check anyway, so no user would see the
refusal; and the same rule flagged `Finir` in a perfectly good French bullet under the other
colon-handling variant, which is a mechanism, not an accident. **F2 was pre-registered as
absolute, and §4 says a mechanism that cannot clear a bar is reported as failing rather than
relaxed.** The numbers are here so the maintainer can overrule that, which is their call and not
this PR's.

### 6.5 Two holes in the matching, found in review

CodeRabbit's review of PR #442 found the anchor matching too loose in two ways, and both were real:

- **`Alice Smith` was grounded by an input naming an unrelated `Alice` and an unrelated `Smith`**
  in different clauses. The first version asked only that every word of an anchor appear
  *somewhere*, so the model could compose a person nobody named out of two who were.
- **`Paul` was grounded by an input containing only `Pauline`**, because the match allowed a prefix
  in either direction. A fabricated name that happens to be a prefix of a real one is precisely the
  shape this check exists to catch.

Matching is now an **ordered, contiguous** sequence over the input's words, with one bounded
allowance: a non-final word of a multi-word anchor may carry one extra trailing letter, which is
there for German declension (`Herr Müller` against `Herrn Müller`) and cannot reach a single-word
anchor. Three cases were added to the corpus — the two failures and the counter-test that the same
full name, adjacent and in order, is still accepted — so they are scored rather than argued.

**`NLTagger`'s recall gap turned up again while writing those tests**, and is worth recording: the
French tagger does not fire on `Paul`, `Paul Durand` or `Marion` in an ordinary bullet, while it
fires on `Alice Smith`. A test of the matching routed through extraction would have passed while
asserting nothing, so the matching rule is tested through an explicit seam and the extraction
recall is pinned separately.

### 6.3 Both — the live suites

| suite | calls | outcome | #393 baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Notes, `notes-fr.json --runs 5` | 30 | 20 success, 10 `rejectedGuardrail` | 24 success, 6 rejected |
| Translate → EN, `translate-en.json --runs 5` | 30 | **30/30 success** | 30/30 success |
| Free polish, `seed.json --runs 5` | 70 | 65 success, 5 rejected | — |
| Free polish auto path, `auto.json --runs 3` | 30 | **30/30 success** | — |

**H1 holds, and the honest reading of the Notes row is that the rise is not this change.** All 10
rejections were scored against the whole-output check on its own: **10 of 10 were already caught
by it**, and the per-segment pass added **zero** rejections across the 160 live calls. The move
from 6/30 to 10/30 is a different draw of a non-deterministic model — N3 drifted 5/5 this time
against 2/5 in round 1. The evidence for #413 is the corpus replay, where the one measured
*accepted* bilingual output lives; the live run simply never produced that shape again.

**The 5 free-polish rejections are the documented DE-Repair Polish leak**, not this change. ADR
0002's 2026-06-08 update describes it exactly: cross-lingual reconstruction into German from a
Romance input reproducibly leaks Polish, the language guardrail catches it, the user gets the raw
fallback. The fixture is `7-repair-de`, the mode is `repair`, and grounding is deliberately **off**
for repair. **Zero of the 100 free-polish calls were rejected by anything this PR added.**

### 6.4 What the checks cost

Measured on this Mac over a 395-character, 7-bullet output against a 656-character input:

| | per call |
|---|---|
| language check, whole output only (before) | 1.17 ms |
| language check, whole + per segment (after) | 6.13 ms |
| grounding check | 2.52 ms |

**About 7.5 ms added**, against an engine call measured here at 1.1–3.1 s: a fifth to two thirds of
one percent. Like every other figure in the #393 campaign, this is a Mac reading and not a device
one — but the checks are pure `NaturalLanguage` calls with no model load, and they run in the
keyboard extension since #361, so the order of magnitude is what matters and it is small.

## 7. Verdict, and what is still open

**#413 is closed.** The measured hole is shut, every bar cleared with margin, and the thresholds
sit in an empty band rather than on a boundary.

**#414 ships a real improvement and does not close.** It rejects the fabrication that was measured
and six of six hand-built ones, with zero false rejections in 83 outputs and 160 live calls. It
misses the same fabrication when the model rewords one clause. That is `NLTagger`'s recall, not a
tuning parameter, and no framing of the input recovers it.

Two things follow, and both are the maintainer's to decide:

1. **The capitalised-token rule is the cheapest next step** and its cost is measured above: 6/7
   one more catch, 2 false rejections in 82, both on outputs the language check already refuses.
2. **#414's own second proposal — neutralising the prompt's worked examples — is deliberately not
   done here.** `SmartModeNotesPrompt` carries the example that was copied, and replacing its
   named person and concrete facts would attack the measured failure at its source. It is not done
   because **a cut decision on Notes is pending on PR #412's measurement, and changing the prompt
   underneath that decision invalidates the evidence it rests on.** #388 also found that examples
   measurably improve output shape, so the change would need its own 30-call run before anyone
   could say it was free. It is a follow-up with a reason, not an omission.

**What #349 inherits.** `PolishGrounding` is the type it asked for, with the tokeniser and the
normalisation it needs. Its question is the *second* query over the same tokens — how much of the
output's vocabulary appears in the input at all — and it is deliberately not written here: it has
no consumer yet, and its threshold has to be sized against a fixture set of refusals that does not
exist. The exclusion of `repair` from the grounding check is written down with #349 named, so the
next person does not read it as an oversight.

---

## 8. #414's second query, written and shipped (2026-09-07)

§7 left #414 open with one measured miss and one paragraph of intent: the anchor check sees a
fabricated **name**, and nothing sees a fabricated **line**. This section is that second query,
measured and shipped. It was written after the numbers, like §5–§7 — the pre-registered bars in
§4 are #413's and #414's original ones and were not rewritten to suit it.

### 8.1 The mechanism

Worst-segment lexical overlap, on `PolishGrounding`:

1. Cut the output into segments — the same line cut `PolishSegmentation` gives #413, so a
   fabricated bullet is judged on its own instead of being diluted by the list around it.
   `N2-reunion-vrac` scores **0.739 whole** and **0.000 on its fabricated bullet**; whole-output
   resolution is the wrong unit and that number is why.
2. Tokenise with `PolishLexicon` — never a second tokeniser, for the reason that type exists.
3. Drop the segment's function words. What remains is its content words.
4. Score each segment as the share of its content words that also appear in the input, take the
   **worst**, and refuse below the floor.
5. Skip a segment carrying fewer than 3 content words: at one or two the share can only be 0, 0.5
   or 1, which is not a measurement.

It runs where `requiresGroundedNames` already runs — Natural, Auto and Notes — and so is off for
Translate and for Repair. It is **not** #349's answer: #349's capture is a repair event, and #466
established that no threshold serves that band.

### 8.2 The two populations, at the shipping thresholds

`swift run polish-harness guardrail ../docs/research/413-414-guardrail/*.json --sweep`

| population | n | min | Q1 | median |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| legitimate, counted | 321 | **0.200** | 0.824 | 0.842 |
| fabricated | 11 | 0.000 (×9) | — | — |

The two fabrications above 0.000 are `Y4-fr-lieu-invente` (0.200) and `Z1-sophie-reoccurrence`
(0.333). **The populations touch at 0.200**, so no floor separates them strictly; 0.15 sits in the
empty band below every legitimate output and takes the nine that score zero.

### 8.3 The confusion matrix

| | caught | false rejections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| anchors (§6.2, unchanged) | 7/11 | 0/328 |
| overlap alone, floor 0.15 | 9/11 | 0/328 |
| **anchors OR overlap — what the pipeline refuses** | **10/11** | **0/328** |

Complementary, not redundant: overlap catches `Y5-refus-applefm` and `Y6` which carry no name at
all, anchors catches `Y4` whose invented place name scores 0.200.

Floor sweep, same corpora:

| floor | overlap alone | with anchors | false rejections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.10 | 9/11 | 10/11 | 0 |
| **0.15** | **9/11** | **10/11** | **0** |
| 0.20 | 9/11 | 10/11 | 0 |
| 0.25 | 10/11 | 10/11 | **1** |

**0.15 rather than 0.25.** 0.25 closes `Z1` and costs one measured false rejection. Pierre declined
that trade on 2026-09-07. If a user reports a fabricated line in the field, 0.25 is the lever and
its cost is already the number above.

### 8.4 The counting rule

**A rejection is charged to a check only when it is a rejection the user would otherwise have
seen.** An output another shipped check already refuses never reaches a document, so refusing it
again is a second lock on a door the first lock closed, and counting it inflates the measured cost.

Pierre wrote that rule on #414 about the language check — the *48-of-57* form: nine of the corpus's
57 legitimate Notes outputs are bilingual or in the wrong language and are refused upstream, so the
bar is read on the 48 a user could see. It is applied here to **both** upstream checks, because the
argument does not distinguish them: the two #466 device captures of an Apple FM preamble are
refused by `PolishPrefixAlignment` on the contract they were captured under. **That extension is
not in the issue text**, which predates #466's check reaching this corpus.

Across the full corpora the overlap check refuses **92** outputs the rule does not charge it for:
10 that the language check refuses (8 `wrongLanguage`, 2 `bilingual`) and 82 that prefix alignment
refuses (81 `displaced`, 1 `unrelated`). The second number is worth reading as a result rather than
as bookkeeping — **the overlap check independently sees 82 of the 88 captured Apple FM preambles**,
which #466 had to build a separate mechanism for. It is not promoted to a second opinion on that
shape here: the ordering in `PolishPipeline` keeps a preamble named `prefixAlignment`, so the rate
#466 ships against stays countable in an export.

Each excluded rejection is printed by the harness under `not counted` rather than dropped silently,
and `PolishGuardrailCorpusReplayTests.testTheCountingRuleExcludesOnlyOutputsAnotherCheckRefuses`
asserts that every excluded output really is refused by a shipped check. The rule is executable,
not prose.

### 8.5 Two corpus corrections, both judgements

- **`freepolish.json` / `auto-newline-marker`, runs 1–3: the `raw` was truncated.** The #466
  harvest from `raw/r4-freepolish-auto-3runs-after.txt` kept only the first of the dictation's
  three lines, so an output faithfully polishing all three read as two invented bullets. Restored
  from the committed capture. This was a data-entry error, not a label.
- **`Y6-notes-abstraite-inventee` added, labelled `fabricated`.** It is the fully abstractive Notes
  list that lived in `PolishPipelineTests` as the fixture proving the prefix check is inert for
  List, written for #466 as an output the mode is *licensed* to produce. Overlap refuses it, and
  the label says that refusal is right: the speaker gave no timeframe, so `Échéance retenue : cette
  semaine` is a date invented for them. **This reverses an earlier judgement**, and the corpus is
  where to disagree with it — the cost of disagreeing is one false rejection at 0.15.

### 8.6 What ships open

**`Z1-sophie-reoccurrence` remains a known miss**, now for both checks: `NLTagger` does not tag
`Sophie` in that continuation (§6.2), and the reworded clause carries enough of the speaker's
grammar to score 0.333. It is pinned by
`PolishGroundingTests.testTheRewordedFabricationIsMISSEDByOverlapToo`, which fails if it ever
closes — the failure is the notification.

`Y4-fr-lieu-invente` is caught by the anchor check, not by overlap, and would need 0.25 here.

Neither check reaches **Repair**, which carries the largest remaining inventory of worked examples
(`GitHub`, `Apple`, `WhisperKit`, `macOS` and a dated fact across the four repair prompts). #466
measured why no relatedness check can serve that mode. That hole is real and is not this issue's.
